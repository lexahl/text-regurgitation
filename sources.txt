research, how surveillance, security, and privacy play out in these much-
neglected contexts.
Around the world there is a rising momentum for data justice.
Eu rope’s new privacy rules will soon serve as a “golden standard” for
privacy rules worldwide. Digital privacy as an essential human right
is gaining traction. In August 2017, India’s Supreme Court made a
landmark ruling establishing that the right to privacy is protected as an
intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty.23 This has imme-
diate implications for the government’s biometric identity project as it
has gone about indiscriminately collating information about the poor,
including their religious beliefs, marital status, and so on. Several cases
have surfaced of mobs lynching people based on their social media
posts about eating beef (which the ruling Hindu party wishes to ban),
their political views on Kashmir, and their sexual preferences. This
ruling aims to protect citizens against these violations.
The ruling also targets technology companies that have been har-
vesting and profiling their users in the absence of personal data pro-
tection laws. Now that such laws are in place, how will this ruling will
affect India and other countries outside the West as they design their
own right-to- privacy laws in today’s digital economy? We know little
about how these rules will trickle down to the poor communities that
are the most likely to be impacted by these changes. Will they be aware
of their new rights? Will they change their online behavior accordingly?
Will their digital play become less circumventing and more confron-
tational, with this newfound freedom?
We now have a glimpse into the world of e-commerce and the global
poor as budding online consumers. After decades of being excluded
from the marketplace, the global poor are gaining fast entry into the
world of digital consumption. Much is happening in online retail at
the margins that demands far more empirical investigation into these
new markets. In September 2017, Alibaba, China’s e-commerce giant,
partnered with the Mexican government to help circulate products and
services from small and midlevel enterprises within Mexico.24 This is

A NOTE ON THE T YPE
This book has been composed in Adobe Text and Gotham.
Adobe Text, designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe,
bridges the gap between fifteenth- and sixteenth-century
calligraphic and eighteenth-century Modern styles.
Gotham, inspired by New York street signs, was designed
by Tobias Frere-Jones for Hoefler & Co.

Abstract
The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.

Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral … technology's interaction with the social ecology is such that technical developments frequently have environmental, social, and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves. (Kranzberg 1986, p. 545)
We need to open a discourse – where there is no effective discourse now – about the varying temporalities, spatialities and materialities that we might represent in our databases, with a view to designing for maximum flexibility and allowing as possible for an emergent polyphony and polychrony. Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea; to the contrary, data should be cooked with care. (Bowker 2005, pp. 183–184)
The era of Big Data is underway. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will analytics be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will large quantities of data transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means?
Big Data is, in many ways, a poor term. As Manovich (2011) observes, it has been used in the sciences to refer to data sets large enough to require supercomputers, but what once required such machines can now be analyzed on desktop computers with standard software. There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are often quite large, but that is not the defining characteristic of this new data ecosystem. In fact, some of the data encompassed by Big Data (e.g. all Twitter messages about a particular topic) are not nearly as large as earlier data sets that were not considered Big Data (e.g. census data). Big Data is less about data that is big than it is about a capacity to search, aggregate, and cross-reference large data sets.
We define Big Data1 as a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of:
1. 	
Technology: maximizing computation power and algorithmic accuracy to gather, analyze, link, and compare large data sets.
2. 	
Analysis: drawing on large data sets to identify patterns in order to make economic, social, technical, and legal claims.
3. 	
Mythology: the widespread belief that large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge that can generate insights that were previously impossible, with the aura of truth, objectivity, and accuracy.
Like other socio-technical phenomena, Big Data triggers both utopian and dystopian rhetoric. On one hand, Big Data is seen as a powerful tool to address various societal ills, offering the potential of new insights into areas as diverse as cancer research, terrorism, and climate change. On the other, Big Data is seen as a troubling manifestation of Big Brother, enabling invasions of privacy, decreased civil freedoms, and increased state and corporate control. As with all socio-technical phenomena, the currents of hope and fear often obscure the more nuanced and subtle shifts that are underway.
Computerized databases are not new. The US Bureau of the Census deployed the world's first automated processing equipment in 1890 – the punch-card machine (Anderson 1988). Relational databases emerged in the 1960s (Fry & Sibley 1974). Personal computing and the Internet have made it possible for a wider range of people – including scholars, marketers, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and motivated individuals – to produce, share, interact with, and organize data. This has resulted in what Savage and Burrows (2007) describe as a crisis in empirical sociology. Data sets that were once obscure and difficult to manage – and, thus, only of interest to social scientists – are now being aggregated and made easily accessible to anyone who is curious, regardless of their training.
How we handle the emergence of an era of Big Data is critical. While the phenomenon is taking place in an environment of uncertainty and rapid change, current decisions will shape the future. With the increased automation of data collection and analysis – as well as algorithms that can extract and illustrate large-scale patterns in human behavior – it is necessary to ask which systems are driving these practices and which are regulating them. Lessig (1999) argues that social systems are regulated by four forces: market, law, social norms, and architecture – or, in the case of technology, code. When it comes to Big Data, these four forces are frequently at odds. The market sees Big Data as pure opportunity: marketers use it to target advertising, insurance providers use it to optimize their offerings, and Wall Street bankers use it to read the market. Legislation has already been proposed to curb the collection and retention of data, usually over concerns about privacy (e.g. the US Do Not Track Online Act of 2011). Features like personalization allow rapid access to more relevant information, but they present difficult ethical questions and fragment the public in troubling ways (Pariser 2011).
There are some significant and insightful studies currently being done that involve Big Data, but it is still necessary to ask critical questions about what all this data means, who gets access to what data, how data analysis is deployed, and to what ends. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data. We are social scientists and media studies scholars who are in regular conversation with computer scientists and informatics experts. The questions that we ask are hard ones without easy answers, although we also describe different pitfalls that may seem obvious to social scientists but are often surprising to those from different disciplines. Due to our interest in and experience with social media, our focus here is mainly on Big Data in social media context. That said, we believe that the questions we are asking are also important to those in other fields. We also recognize that the questions we are asking are just the beginning and we hope that this article will spark others to question the assumptions embedded in Big Data. Researchers in all areas – including computer science, business, and medicine – have a stake in the computational culture of Big Data precisely because of its extended reach of influence and potential within multiple disciplines. We believe that it is time to start critically interrogating this phenomenon, its assumptions, and its biases.
1. Big Data changes the definition of knowledge
In the early decades of the twentieth century, Henry Ford devised a manufacturing system of mass production, using specialized machinery and standardized products. It quickly became the dominant vision of technological progress. ‘Fordism’ meant automation and assembly lines; for decades onward, this became the orthodoxy of manufacturing: out with skilled craftspeople and slow work, in with a new machine-made era (Baca 2004). But it was more than just a new set of tools. The twentieth century was marked by Fordism at a cellular level: it produced a new understanding of labor, the human relationship to work, and society at large.
Big Data not only refers to very large data sets and the tools and procedures used to manipulate and analyze them, but also to a computational turn in thought and research (Burkholder 1992). Just as Ford changed the way we made cars – and then transformed work itself – Big Data has emerged a system of knowledge that is already changing the objects of knowledge, while also having the power to inform how we understand human networks and community. ‘Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them’, Latour (2009) reminds us (p. 9).
Big Data creates a radical shift in how we think about research. Commenting on computational social science, Lazer et al. (2009) argue that it offers ‘the capacity to collect and analyze data with an unprecedented breadth and depth and scale’ (p. 722). It is neither just a matter of scale nor is it enough to consider it in terms of proximity, or what Moretti (2007) refers to as distant or close analysis of texts. Rather, it is a profound change at the levels of epistemology and ethics. Big Data reframes key questions about the constitution of knowledge, the processes of research, how we should engage with information, and the nature and the categorization of reality. Just as Du Gay and Pryke (2002) note that ‘accounting tools … do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure’ (pp. 12–13), so Big Data stakes out new terrains of objects, methods of knowing, and definitions of social life.
Speaking in praise of what he terms ‘The Petabyte Age’, Anderson, Editor-in-Chief of Wired, writes:
This is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool that might be brought to bear. Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. (2008)
Do numbers speak for themselves? We believe the answer is ‘no’. Significantly, Anderson's sweeping dismissal of all other theories and disciplines is a tell: it reveals an arrogant undercurrent in many Big Data debates where other forms of analysis are too easily sidelined. Other methods for ascertaining why people do things, write things, or make things are lost in the sheer volume of numbers. This is not a space that has been welcoming to older forms of intellectual craft. As Berry (2011, p. 8) writes, Big Data provides ‘destablising amounts of knowledge and information that lack the regulating force of philosophy’. Instead of philosophy – which Kant saw as the rational basis for all institutions – ‘computationality might then be understood as an ontotheology, creating a new ontological “epoch” as a new historical constellation of intelligibility’ (Berry 2011, p. 12).
We must ask difficult questions of Big Data's models of intelligibility before they crystallize into new orthodoxies. If we return to Ford, his innovation was using the assembly line to break down interconnected, holistic tasks into simple, atomized, mechanistic ones. He did this by designing specialized tools that strongly predetermined and limited the action of the worker. Similarly, the specialized tools of Big Data also have their own inbuilt limitations and restrictions. For example, Twitter and Facebook are examples of Big Data sources that offer very poor archiving and search functions. Consequently, researchers are much more likely to focus on something in the present or immediate past – tracking reactions to an election, TV finale, or natural disaster – because of the sheer difficulty or impossibility of accessing older data.
If we are observing the automation of particular kinds of research functions, then we must consider the inbuilt flaws of the machine tools. It is not enough to simply ask, as Anderson has suggested ‘what can science learn from Google?’, but to ask how the harvesters of Big Data might change the meaning of learning, and what new possibilities and new limitations may come with these systems of knowing.
2. Claims to objectivity and accuracy are misleading
‘Numbers, numbers, numbers’, writes Latour (2009). ‘Sociology has been obsessed by the goal of becoming a quantitative science’. Sociology has never reached this goal, in Latour's view, because of where it draws the line between what is and is not quantifiable knowledge in the social domain.
Big Data offers the humanistic disciplines a new way to claim the status of quantitative science and objective method. It makes many more social spaces quantifiable. In reality, working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth – particularly when considering messages from social media sites. But there remains a mistaken belief that qualitative researchers are in the business of interpreting stories and quantitative researchers are in the business of producing facts. In this way, Big Data risks re-inscribing established divisions in the long running debates about scientific method and the legitimacy of social science and humanistic inquiry.
The notion of objectivity has been a central question for the philosophy of science and early debates about the scientific method (Durkheim 1895). Claims to objectivity suggest an adherence to the sphere of objects, to things as they exist in and for themselves. Subjectivity, on the other hand, is viewed with suspicion, colored as it is with various forms of individual and social conditioning. The scientific method attempts to remove itself from the subjective domain through the application of a dispassionate process whereby hypotheses are proposed and tested, eventually resulting in improvements in knowledge. Nonetheless, claims to objectivity are necessarily made by subjects and are based on subjective observations and choices.
All researchers are interpreters of data. As Gitelman (2011) observes, data need to be imagined as data in the first instance, and this process of the imagination of data entails an interpretative base: ‘every discipline and disciplinary institution has its own norms and standards for the imagination of data’. As computational scientists have started engaging in acts of social science, there is a tendency to claim their work as the business of facts and not interpretation. A model may be mathematically sound, an experiment may seem valid, but as soon as a researcher seeks to understand what it means, the process of interpretation has begun. This is not to say that all interpretations are created equal, but rather that not all numbers are neutral.
The design decisions that determine what will be measured also stem from interpretation. For example, in the case of social media data, there is a ‘data cleaning’ process: making decisions about what attributes and variables will be counted, and which will be ignored. This process is inherently subjective. As Bollier explains,
As a large mass of raw information, Big Data is not self-explanatory. And yet the specific methodologies for interpreting the data are open to all sorts of philosophical debate. Can the data represent an ‘objective truth’ or is any interpretation necessarily biased by some subjective filter or the way that data is ‘cleaned?’. (2010, p. 13)
In addition to this question, there is the issue of data errors. Large data sets from Internet sources are often unreliable, prone to outages and losses, and these errors and gaps are magnified when multiple data sets are used together. Social scientists have a long history of asking critical questions about the collection of data and trying to account for any biases in their data (Cain & Finch 1981; Clifford & Marcus 1986). This requires understanding the properties and limits of a data set, regardless of its size. A data set may have many millions of pieces of data, but this does not mean it is random or representative. To make statistical claims about a data set, we need to know where data is coming from; it is similarly important to know and account for the weaknesses in that data. Furthermore, researchers must be able to account for the biases in their interpretation of the data. To do so requires recognizing that one's identity and perspective informs one's analysis (Behar & Gordon 1996).
Too often, Big Data enables the practice of apophenia: seeing patterns where none actually exist, simply because enormous quantities of data can offer connections that radiate in all directions. In one notable example, Leinweber (2007) demonstrated that data mining techniques could show a strong but spurious correlation between the changes in the S&P 500 stock index and butter production in Bangladesh.
Interpretation is at the center of data analysis. Regardless of the size of a data, it is subject to limitation and bias. Without those biases and limitations being understood and outlined, misinterpretation is the result. Data analysis is most effective when researchers take account of the complex methodological processes that underlie the analysis of that data.
3. Bigger data are not always better data
Social scientists have long argued that what makes their work rigorous is rooted in their systematic approach to data collection and analysis (McCloskey 1985). Ethnographers focus on reflexively accounting for bias in their interpretations. Experimentalists control and standardize the design of their experiment. Survey researchers drill down on sampling mechanisms and question bias. Quantitative researchers weigh up statistical significance. These are but a few of the ways in which social scientists try to assess the validity of each other's work. Just because Big Data presents us with large quantities of data does not mean that methodological issues are no longer relevant. Understanding sample, for example, is more important now than ever.
Twitter provides an example in the context of a statistical analysis. Because it is easy to obtain – or scrape – Twitter data, scholars have used Twitter to examine a wide variety of patterns (e.g. mood rhythms (Golder & Macy 2011), media event engagement (Shamma et al. 2010), political uprisings (Lotan et al. 2011), and conversational interactions (Wu et al. 2011)). While many scholars are conscientious about discussing the limitations of Twitter data in their publications, the public discourse around such research tends to focus on the raw number of tweets available. Even news coverage of scholarship tends to focus on how many millions of ‘people’ were studied (Wang 2011).
Twitter does not represent ‘all people’, and it is an error to assume ‘people’ and ‘Twitter users’ are synonymous: they are a very particular sub-set. Neither is the population using Twitter representative of the global population. Nor can we assume that accounts and users are equivalent. Some users have multiple accounts, while some accounts are used by multiple people. Some people never establish an account, and simply access Twitter via the web. Some accounts are ‘bots’ that produce automated content without directly involving a person. Furthermore, the notion of an ‘active’ account is problematic. While some users post content frequently through Twitter, others participate as ‘listeners’ (Crawford 2009, p. 532). Twitter Inc. has revealed that 40 percent of active users sign in just to listen (Twitter 2011). The very meanings of ‘user’ and ‘participation’ and ‘active’ need to be critically examined.
Big Data and whole data are also not the same. Without taking into account the sample of a data set, the size of the data set is meaningless. For example, a researcher may seek to understand the topical frequency of tweets, yet if Twitter removes all tweets that contain problematic words or content – such as references to pornography or spam – from the stream, the topical frequency would be inaccurate. Regardless of the number of tweets, it is not a representative sample as the data is skewed from the beginning.
It is also hard to understand the sample when the source is uncertain. Twitter Inc. makes a fraction of its material available to the public through its APIs.2 The ‘firehose’ theoretically contains all public tweets ever posted and explicitly excludes any tweet that a user chose to make private or ‘protected’. Yet, some publicly accessible tweets are also missing from the firehose. Although a handful of companies have access to the firehose, very few researchers have this level of access. Most either have access to a ‘gardenhose’ (roughly 10 percent of public tweets), a ‘spritzer’ (roughly one percent of public tweets), or have used ‘white-listed’ accounts where they could use the APIs to get access to different subsets of content from the public stream.3 It is not clear what tweets are included in these different data streams or sampling them represents. It could be that the API pulls a random sample of tweets or that it pulls the first few thousand tweets per hour or that it only pulls tweets from a particular segment of the network graph. Without knowing, it is difficult for researchers to make claims about the quality of the data that they are analyzing. Are the data representative of all tweets? No, because they exclude tweets from protected accounts.4 But are the data representative of all public tweets? Perhaps, but not necessarily.
Twitter has become a popular source for mining Big Data, but working with Twitter data has serious methodological challenges that are rarely addressed by those who embrace it. When researchers approach a data set, they need to understand – and publicly account for – not only the limits of the data set, but also the limits of which questions they can ask of a data set and what interpretations are appropriate.
This is especially true when researchers combine multiple large data sets. This does not mean that combining data does not offer valuable insights – studies like those by Acquisti and Gross (2009) are powerful, as they reveal how public databases can be combined to produce serious privacy violations, such as revealing an individual's Social Security number. Yet, as Jesper Anderson, co-founder of open financial data store FreeRisk, explains: combining data from multiple sources creates unique challenges. ‘Every one of those sources is error-prone … I think we are just magnifying that problem [when we combine multiple data sets]’ (Bollier 2010, p. 13).
Finally, during this computational turn, it is increasingly important to recognize the value of ‘small data’. Research insights can be found at any level, including at very modest scales. In some cases, focusing just on a single individual can be extraordinarily valuable. Take, for example, the work of Veinot (2007), who followed one worker – a vault inspector at a hydroelectric utility company – in order to understand the information practices of a blue-collar worker. In doing this unusual study, Veinot reframed the definition of ‘information practices’ away from the usual focus on early-adopter, white-collar workers, to spaces outside of the offices and urban context. Her work tells a story that could not be discovered by farming millions of Facebook or Twitter accounts, and contributes to the research field in a significant way, despite the smallest possible participant count. The size of data should fit the research question being asked; in some cases, small is best.
4. Taken out of context, Big Data loses its meaning
Because large data sets can be modeled, data are often reduced to what can fit into a mathematical model. Yet, taken out of context, data lose meaning and value. The rise of social network sites prompted an industry-driven obsession with the ‘social graph’. Thousands of researchers have flocked to Twitter and Facebook and other social media to analyze connections between messages and accounts, making claims about social networks. Yet, the relations displayed through social media are not necessarily equivalent to the sociograms and kinship networks that sociologists and anthropologists have been investigating since the 1930s (Radcliffe-Brown 1940; Freeman 2006). The ability to represent relationships between people as a graph does not mean that they convey equivalent information.
Historically, sociologists and anthropologists collected data about people's relationships through surveys, interviews, observations, and experiments. Using this data, they focused on describing people's ‘personal networks’ – the set of relationships that individuals develop and maintain (Fischer 1982). These connections were evaluated based on a series of measures developed over time to identify personal connections. Big Data introduces two new popular types of social networks derived from data traces: ‘articulated networks’ and ‘behavioral networks’.
Articulated networks are those that result from people specifying their contacts through technical mechanisms like email or cell phone address books, instant messaging buddy lists, ‘Friends’ lists on social network sites, and ‘Follower’ lists on other social media genres. The motivations that people have for adding someone to each of these lists vary widely, but the result is that these lists can include friends, colleagues, acquaintances, celebrities, friends-of-friends, public figures, and interesting strangers.
Behavioral networks are derived from communication patterns, cell coordinates, and social media interactions (Onnela et al. 2007; Meiss et al. 2008). These might include people who text message one another, those who are tagged in photos together on Facebook, people who email one another, and people who are physically in the same space, at least according to their cell phone.
Both behavioral and articulated networks have great value to researchers, but they are not equivalent to personal networks. For example, although contested, the concept of ‘tie strength’ is understood to indicate the importance of individual relationships (Granovetter 1973). When mobile phone data suggest that workers spend more time with colleagues than their spouse, this does not necessarily imply that colleagues are more important than spouses. Measuring tie strength through frequency or public articulation is a common mistake: tie strength – and many of the theories built around it – is a subtle reckoning in how people understand and value their relationships with other people. Not every connection is equivalent to every other connection, and neither does frequency of contact indicate strength of relationship. Further, the absence of a connection does not necessarily indicate that a relationship should be made.
Data are not generic. There is value to analyzing data abstractions, yet retaining context remains critical, particularly for certain lines of inquiry. Context is hard to interpret at scale and even harder to maintain when data are reduced to fit into a model. Managing context in light of Big Data will be an ongoing challenge.
5. Just because it is accessible does not make it ethical
In 2006, a Harvard-based research group started gathering the profiles of 1,700 college-based Facebook users to study how their interests and friendships changed over time (Lewis et al. 2008). These supposedly anonymous data were released to the world, allowing other researchers to explore and analyze them. What other researchers quickly discovered was that it was possible to de-anonymize parts of the data set: compromising the privacy of students, none of whom were aware their data were being collected (Zimmer 2008).
The case made headlines and raised difficult issues for scholars: what is the status of so-called ‘public’ data on social media sites? Can it simply be used, without requesting permission? What constitutes best ethical practice for researchers? Privacy campaigners already see this as a key battleground where better privacy protections are needed. The difficulty is that privacy breaches are hard to make specific – is there damage done at the time? What about 20 years hence? ‘Any data on human subjects inevitably raise privacy issues, and the real risks of abuse of such data are difficult to quantify’ (Nature, cited in Berry 2011).
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) – and other research ethics committees – emerged in the 1970s to oversee research on human subjects. While unquestionably problematic in implementation (Schrag 2010), the goal of IRBs is to provide a framework for evaluating the ethics of a particular line of research inquiry and to make certain that checks and balances are put into place to protect subjects. Practices like ‘informed consent’ and protecting the privacy of informants are intended to empower participants in light of earlier abuses in the medical and social sciences (Blass 2004; Reverby 2009). Although IRBs cannot always predict the harm of a particular study – and, all too often, prevent researchers from doing research on grounds other than ethics – their value is in prompting researchers to think critically about the ethics of their project.
Very little is understood about the ethical implications underpinning the Big Data phenomenon. Should someone be included as a part of a large aggregate of data? What if someone's ‘public’ blog post is taken out of context and analyzed in a way that the author never imagined? What does it mean for someone to be spotlighted or to be analyzed without knowing it? Who is responsible for making certain that individuals and communities are not hurt by the research process? What does informed consent look like?
It may be unreasonable to ask researchers to obtain consent from every person who posts a tweet, but it is problematic for researchers to justify their actions as ethical simply because the data are accessible. Just because content is publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone. There are serious issues involved in the ethics of online data collection and analysis (Ess 2002). The process of evaluating the research ethics cannot be ignored simply because the data are seemingly public. Researchers must keep asking themselves – and their colleagues – about the ethics of their data collection, analysis, and publication.
In order to act ethically, it is important that researchers reflect on the importance of accountability: both to the field of research and to the research subjects. Accountability here is used as a broader concept than privacy, as Troshynski et al. (2008) have outlined, where the concept of accountability can apply even when conventional expectations of privacy are not in question. Instead, accountability is a multi-directional relationship: there may be accountability to superiors, to colleagues, to participants, and to the public (Dourish & Bell 2011). Academic scholars are held to specific professional standards when working with human participants in order to protect informants’ rights and well-being. However, many ethics boards do not understand the processes of mining and anonymizing Big Data, let alone the errors that can cause data to become personally identifiable. Accountability requires rigorous thinking about the ramifications of Big Data, rather than assuming that ethics boards will necessarily do the work of ensuring that people are protected.
There are also significant questions of truth, control, and power in Big Data studies: researchers have the tools and the access, while social media users as a whole do not. Their data were created in highly context-sensitive spaces, and it is entirely possible that some users would not give permission for their data to be used elsewhere. Many are not aware of the multiplicity of agents and algorithms currently gathering and storing their data for future use. Researchers are rarely in a user's imagined audience. Users are not necessarily aware of all the multiple uses, profits, and other gains that come from information they have posted. Data may be public (or semi-public) but this does not simplistically equate with full permission being given for all uses. Big Data researchers rarely acknowledge that there is a considerable difference between being in public (i.e. sitting in a park) and being public (i.e. actively courting attention) (boyd & Marwick 2011).
6. Limited access to Big Data creates new digital divides
In an essay on Big Data, Golder (2010) quotes sociologist Homans (1974): ‘The methods of social science are dear in time and money and getting dearer every day’. Historically speaking, collecting data has been hard, time consuming, and resource intensive. Much of the enthusiasm surrounding Big Data stems from the perception that it offers easy access to massive amounts of data.
But who gets access? For what purposes? In what contexts? And with what constraints? While the explosion of research using data sets from social media sources would suggest that access is straightforward, it is anything but. As Manovich (2011) points out, ‘only social media companies have access to really large social data – especially transactional data. An anthropologist working for Facebook or a sociologist working for Google will have access to data that the rest of the scholarly community will not’. Some companies restrict access to their data entirely; others sell the privilege of access for a fee; and others offer small data sets to university-based researchers. This produces considerable unevenness in the system: those with money – or those inside the company – can produce a different type of research than those outside. Those without access can neither reproduce nor evaluate the methodological claims of those who have privileged access.
It is also important to recognize that the class of the Big Data rich is reinforced through the university system: top-tier, well-resourced universities will be able to buy access to data, and students from the top universities are the ones most likely to be invited to work within large social media companies. Those from the periphery are less likely to get those invitations and develop their skills. The result is that the divisions between scholars will widen significantly.
In addition to questions of access, there are questions of skills. Wrangling APIs, scraping, and analyzing big swathes of data is a skill set generally restricted to those with a computational background. When computational skills are positioned as the most valuable, questions emerge over who is advantaged and who is disadvantaged in such a context. This, in its own way, sets up new hierarchies around ‘who can read the numbers’, rather than recognizing that computer scientists and social scientists both have valuable perspectives to offer. Significantly, this is also a gendered division. Most researchers who have computational skills at the present moment are male and, as feminist historians and philosophers of science have demonstrated, who is asking the questions determines which questions are asked (Harding 2010; Forsythe 2001). There are complex questions about what kinds of research skills are valued in the future and how those skills are taught. How can students be educated so that they are equally comfortable with algorithms and data analysis as well as with social analysis and theory?
Finally, the difficulty and expense of gaining access to Big Data produce a restricted culture of research findings. Large data companies have no responsibility to make their data available, and they have total control over who gets to see them. Big Data researchers with access to proprietary data sets are less likely to choose questions that are contentious to a social media company if they think it may result in their access being cut. The chilling effects on the kinds of research questions that can be asked – in public or private – are something we all need to consider when assessing the future of Big Data.
The current ecosystem around Big Data creates a new kind of digital divide: the Big Data rich and the Big Data poor. Some company researchers have even gone so far as to suggest that academics should not bother studying social media data sets – Jimmy Lin, a professor on industrial sabbatical at Twitter argued that academics should not engage in research that industry ‘can do better’ (Conover 2011). Such explicit efforts to demarcate research ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ – while by no means new – undermine the research community. ‘Effective democratisation can always be measured by this essential criterion’, Derrida (1996) claimed, ‘the participation in and access to the archive, its constitution, and its interpretation’ (p. 4).
Whenever inequalities are explicitly written into the system, they produce class-based structures. Manovich (2011) writes of three classes of people in the realm of Big Data: ‘those who create data (both consciously and by leaving digital footprints), those who have the means to collect it, and those who have expertise to analyze it’. We know that the last group is the smallest, and the most privileged: they are also the ones who get to determine the rules about how Big Data will be used, and who gets to participate. While institutional inequalities may be a forgone conclusion in academia, they should nevertheless be examined and questioned. They produce a bias in the data and the types of research that emerge.
By arguing that the Big Data phenomenon is implicated in some broad historical and philosophical shifts is not to suggest it is solely accountable; the academy is by no means the sole driver behind the computational turn. There is a deep government and industrial drive toward gathering and extracting maximal value from data, be it information that will lead to more targeted advertising, product design, traffic planning, or criminal policing. But we do think there are serious and wide-ranging implications for the operationalization of Big Data, and what it will mean for future research agendas. As Suchman (2011) observes, via Levi Strauss, ‘we are our tools’. We should consider how the tools participate in shaping the world with us as we use them. The era of Big Data has only just begun, but it is already important that we start questioning the assumptions, values, and biases of this new wave of research. As scholars who are invested in the production of knowledge, such interrogations are an essential component of what we do.

Notes
We have chosen to capitalize the term ‘Big Data' throughout this article to make it clear that it is the phenomenon we are discussing.
API stands for application programming interface; this refers to a set of tools that developers can use to access structured data.
Details of what Twitter provides can be found at https://dev.Twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/methods White-listed accounts were commonly used by researchers, but they are no longer available.
The percentage of protected accounts is unknown, although attempts to identify protected accounts suggest that under 10 percent of accounts are protected (Meeder et al. 2010).

Messing with the attractiveness algorithm: a response to
queering code/space
Jen Jack Gieseking

ABSTRACT
Responding to the collection of articles, ‘Queering Code/
Space,’ this article discusses how algorithms affect the
production of online lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
queer (LGBTQ) spaces, namely online dating sites. The set
of articles is well timed: lesbian bars have closed en masse
across the US and many gay male bars have followed suit so
that online spaces fill – or perhaps make – a gap in the social
production of LGBTQ spaces. I draw on Cindi Katz’s idea of
‘messy’ qualities of social reproduction and the necessity of
‘messing’ with dominant narratives in order to think about the
labor, experience, and project of queering code/space.
If I had not been dating on and off since the rise of internet dating, and if I didn’t
study the lesbian and queer production of digital and material spaces (which
often overlap), I would not have made sense of the years of frustration and anxi-
ety I have heard among lesbian, queer, and trans (LQT) folks. At parties and bars,
femme and feminine-presenting LQT people would say upon meeting me (a six
foot, white, sizeable butch/trans dyke): ‘Why haven’t we met? Oh, because there
are no butches and/or transmen (et al.) on OkCupid.’ In homes and on the street,
butches, transmen, and masculine-presenting LQT people told me: ‘I can’t meet
a girl. There are no femmes on OkCupid.’ Surely butches and femmes do not only
date one another but those that do are stymied. Why? Sitting next to a white,
svelte, symmetrical, feminine, bisexual friend in a café in New York City, I noticed
her possible matches: all bisexual and feminine-presenting women, almost all
white – a group that OkCupid says are their most ‘attractive’ users. I opened mine
and revealed a multi-raced amalgam of butches and transmen, feminine ciswomen
and transwomen, many of whom were less svelte, less symmetrical, etc. We made
eye contact as I realized the anecdotal tales we told making sense of our lives were
actually designed by algorithms to keep us apart.

The bias in the algorithm shaping online dating is defined by expectations and
norms around power. OkCupid, like many other dating websites, boasts about its
‘attractiveness algorithm.’ With enough clicks on your profile soon after you join the
site, OkCupid marks you as ‘attractive’ so that you only see and are seen by other
‘attractive’ people. The company would send ‘attractive’ users an email notification
that ended with the utterly tactless statement: ‘And, no, we didn’t just send this
email to everyone on OkCupid. Go ask an ugly friend and see’ (Lothlorien 2012).
Cruel and unapologetic, the email is no longer sent to users marked ‘attractive’
but its sorting and categorizing persists in the background. What would it mean
to mess with the algorithm on behalf of queers and queering? And what would it
mean to queer not only sites like OkCupid but code itself?
I begin (and conclude) with this anecdote to situate my thoughts on queer dig-
ital-material life since much of the way code produces life is purposefully veiled,
purportedly mysterious, and heavily proprietary. I take the notion of ‘messing with’
from Cindi Katz’s reflection on David Harvey’s writings on urban political economy,
which she contends is ‘a refusal of certain kinds of mess: the mess of difference, the
mess of scale and the mess of indeterminacy’ (2006, 241). Elsewhere, the ‘mess’ Katz
refers to relates to social reproduction, which she describes as the ‘fleshy, messy,
and indeterminate stuff of everyday life. It is also a set of structured practices that
unfold in dialectical relation with production, with which it is mutually constitutive
and in tension’ (2001, 711). What else is queering then but an engagement with
mess – both visible (often read as: production) and invisible (almost always: social
reproduction) – ‘attractive’ in all possible forms?
Work in geographies of sexualities has increasingly expanded the public’s lim-
ited geographical imagination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
(LGBTQ) spaces through studies of ruralities, suburbs, WNBA games, and, increas-
ingly over recent years, online spaces (cf. Brown and Browne 2016). By extending
Kitchin and Dodge’s (2011) concept of code/space, this collection of articles takes
the queer digital to new level. Kitchin and Dodge contend that code/space sur-
rounds us in the mutual constitution of software and the spatiality of everyday
life. The effort to queer code/space here helps us rethink the co-production of
code and space through the lens of everyday trans, and gay and non-heterosexual
male lives and a rigorous application of queer theory. The only absence I noticed
across these articles is a failure to take up a political economic critique that runs
through all discussions of data, algorithms, software, and systems today; I include
my own thoughts on OkCupid to help to fill that gap. As code, data, algorithms,
and software already shape our everyday lives, it is necessary to queer assumptions
that products are ‘free’ when we give our data and labor away to them, data and
labor that is often worth much more to corporations than most could imagine.
LGBTQ studies has long been a part of geography but queer theory’s entrance
is more recent. Oswin’s 2008 article was a significant effort to place queer theory
and geography in conversation. Her concept of queer space highlighted a specifi-
cally queer approach to the discipline and politics. Oswin writes, ‘The equation of
GENDER, PLACE & CULTURE 1661
queerness with visibility has been severely questioned and the insistence upon
a trajectory from unliberated, prepolitical homosexual practice to liberated, out,
politicized, gay subjectivity has been abandoned’ (2008, 780). A decade later, invig-
orated by ‘what a focus on queer experiences and bodies might bring to contem-
porary digital technology,’ Cockayne and Richardson write in their introduction that
queer theory might contribute to an ambivalent theorization of the relationship
between the human and technology that would emphasize both a spatio-temporal
contingency to the assertion of ‘the human’ as an ordering device, and an instability that
potentially troubles the logic of that order (Cockayne and Richardson, 4).
Such a sentiment reiterates Oswin’s vision of questioning the politics of visibility as
the route to liberation, but also undergirds the primacy of human typologies fore-
most as the road toward freedom. Instead, the messy project of queerness requires
upending assumptions, norms, and even order. To be queer is to be messy. To be
queer is to live a life full or at least always in part outside of state-sanctioned pat-
terns of social reproduction. What other way is there to conceive of queer radicality
but as a mess, a failure, a fissure in the neoliberal order that relies on productivity,
normality, and visibility to determine which lives are deemed worthy?
In an invigorating collection, the three central articles offer empirical studies
of queer life interfacing, shaping, and being shaped by code across interfaces,
places, and ages while the fourth returns more explicitly to theoretical concerns.
The set of articles is well timed: lesbian bars have closed en masse across the US
and many gay male bars have followed suit so that online spaces fill – or perhaps
make – a gap in the social production of LGBTQ spaces. Two of the empirical articles
focus primarily on the hookup app Grindr, and the third on Tumblr and YouTube.
Sam Miles’ research into non-heterosexual men’s experiences in London, UK using
Grindr as they ‘navigate online spaces in pursuit of embodied meaning,’ i.e. to
find a digital connection that makes way for material intimacy. He expands upon
recent discussions of the hybridization of digital-material life through ‘unrealized’
community: ‘the potential for online sociality if qualified by its co-option as a tool
to pursue sexual encounter.’ Relatedly, one of Miles’ participants, Malcolm, shared
that ‘for a lot of people, it’s just the fantasy of speaking to someone.’ This idea and
quote illustrate that the seemingly easy navigations of sexual contact among gay,
queer, and bisexual men and MSM are perhaps made more complicated – but
perhaps not the fun sort of sexual messy – when fed through the likes of Grindr.
My reading of these arguments recalls queer theorist Samuel Delany’s arguments
between the affordances of contact versus networking in the closing of working
class gay men’s and MSM cruising space at the turn of the century (Delany 2001).
It is possible that the social reproduction of queer men’s worlds becomes all the
more fragile when in-depth, in-person contact is replaced with superficial digital
networking – but the long-term effects are far from visible.
The power to shape queer life lies not just within lines of code. In his research
into gay men’s use of Grindr in the working-class town of Newcastle, UK, Carl
Bonner-Thompson looks at the gendered regulatory practices formed through the
1662 J. J. GIESEKING
use of Grindr: the construction and embodiment of two types of masculinity. A
hypersexualized masculinity is revealed in sultry visuals that men provide, while a
lifestyle masculinity is produced through a photo’s context to demonstrate rugged
sensuality. Challenging cross-age, cross-race, and cross-class bending sex extrava-
ganza that Delany documented in Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, Thompson’s
analysis reveals gay men’s long-held bias toward equating beauty with youth and
normative ideas of health. Thompson also speaks to the frustration and loneliness
such beauty norms affect for app users who do not fit the panopticon driven
‘attractive’ norming practices. The reconstruction of gay male life through digital
spaces is much messier than earlier theorists like Delany imagined. The ageism,
ableism, racism, and masculinism of Grindr is re-produced by and within code,
which Thompson describes as a practice of active consumption. This reminder
speaks to the power that LGBTQ people have to shape their lives and desires, and
to queer norms around what is ‘attractive.’
In Olu Jenzen’s participatory research with trans youth in Brighton, UK, partic-
ipants challenged public assumptions about trans lives: namely that while the
internet gives a platform for bullying and discrimination it also affords young peo-
ple a space to understand and produce their own gender. In a shared critique of
cis-media and queer media alike, the youth found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual
online spaces do not, as Jenzen writes, ‘necessarily produce a “safe” space or keep
out transphobic or exploitative content from a user’s digest of posts.’ Instead, it is
through effortful navigation of spaces/sites like Tumblr and YouTube that youth
produce and remake their own content, sharing it back and forth. In their use of
these platforms, her participants embrace where there is a ‘sense of networked
connections where the LGBTQ identification, subculture or vocabulary are not the
primary points of recognition or connection.’ Further, it is both visual and audial
qualities of Tumblr and YouTube that afford a ‘complex and haptic sensation of
embodiment that is less about simple representation and more about being in
space.’ Greatly advancing the work done to date on trans online youth culture,
Jenzen speaks to the messiness of queer life found in this group’s social repro-
duction of trans culture. They negotiate and produce a sense of self, other, and
network all at once, while determining what is meaningful not just to survive but
to thrive. Some youth are limited in their access to these spaces (at school and/or
home) but many nevertheless find ways to connect, prevailing to mess with the
cis- and hetero-norms of material and digital life.
In the fourth paper of this special issue, Cockayne and Richardson’s ‘Queering
Code/Space’ article bridges the work on digital studies and queer geographies to
argue for approaches to queer code/space as a meditation on the intersection of
sexuality, code, and space: discursive regulation, performativity, and dissolution
of models that predict or expect normative identities and practices within spaces.
My favorite example is their vivid re-reading of Kitchin and Dodge’s writing on
airports as ‘docile bodies’ through the lens of queer life. Instead, the authors high-
light (and, for me as a trans person, recall) the biopolitics of being determined
GENDER, PLACE & CULTURE 1663
into regulatory identification documents that queers would not choose as their
own, embracing disdained performativities to bypass frisking and groping, and
the normative, binary gender drop-down we are forced to choose between even
as you purchase your ticket. As a reply to the anti-social focus of queer theory in
the last decade, geography offers, in this paper, an approach to difference in place
from the point of view of the socially awkward life of queers whose everyday life
affords necessary acts of messing with norms and ideals. Near their conclusion,
Cockayne and Richardson write: ‘Instead of any simple distinction between (cod-
ing) oppressor and (coded) oppressed, the binaries of normative dualisms mesh
such that the operations and outcomes of their regulatory power can become
opaque.’ In other words, we are reminded that queer code/space is the messy labor
of actual living, coding, fucking, loving, being, breathing.
In closing, I need to return to my opening anecdote. When speaking to lesbians
and queers over the last decade about their spaces in the US, I ask them which
dating site they have used, the answer is OkCupid (with Tinder now on par or at
times dominating). Why, I then ask? Because of the algorithm, they say. OkCupid
launched in 2004 and quickly included (at the time) woman-for-woman and man-
for-man options, drawing in a huge LGBTQ population when few mainstream sites
thought to include LGBTQ people and many sites refused them on purpose. The
founder of eHarmony, for example, has argued that homosexuality is ‘a painful way
for people to live’ and lost a discrimination suit in state courts, eventually launch-
ing the tragically named Compatible Partners site to cater to same-sex couples
(LGBTQ Nation 2013). In stark corporate contrast, OkCupid was applauded for its
more recent inclusion of a range of genders; your search can now be based on
gender or sexuality identifiers, but the variety of options has led users to tell me
that they have to run multiple searches to see everyone they may find of interest.
Yet LGBTQ people still remain ignored and invisibilized on OkCupid, even as
target advertisements toward this group on the site and users, including LGBTQ
people, purchase accounts for further access and to increase their ‘visibility’ to be
seen more often by other users (often beyond their ‘attractive’ status). All of these
acts further the corporation’s wealth. And then there is the real jackpot: the data,
and marketing the analytics and information within it. OkCupid’s data is proprie-
tary, a reminder that there is comparatively little access to big data sets on LGBTQ
history (Gieseking 2017). In fact, most data on LGBTQ lives online is not in the hands
of queers but rather in the hands of those few who can access all of the data of
social media platforms and search engines, which includes a select group of cor-
porations, governments, and universities (see Boyd and Crawford 2012). OkCupid
co-founder Christian Rudder wrote a book analyzing the OkCupid data, a book
that illuminates nothing about difference. Instead, the text’s analysis reiterates
the bias toward white, heterosexual, cisgender, Western males who are able-bod-
ied, healthy, and aged appropriately as the norm, time and time again. How else
would an ‘attractiveness algorithm’ be defined by corporate America but on these
measures? The articles in this special issue amplify the work of critical scholars
1664 J. J. GIESEKING
of digital spaces across the social science and humanities that recall how code is
structured by those in power – and how code can be rewritten to produce worlds
that herald difference and diversity (see Bivens and Haimson 2016; Gieseking
forthcoming; Gray 2009; Lingel and Golub 2015; McPherson 2012; Thatcher,
O’Sullivan, and Mahmoudi 2016).
Code/space is the world we experience and reproduce through our inter-
actions with software, code, algorithms, and networks. Like Oswin’s work and
the work of scholars of queer geography, each of the contributions reveal that
racism, homophobia, transphobia, colonialism, and patriarchy are made visible
in our data, software platforms, and interfaces. Oswin also reminds us that visi-
bility does not equal liberation. Attraction isn’t algorithmic. Social reproduction
cannot be coded. Life is messy and the project of messing with injustice is more
important now than ever. Simultaneously, the power to produce space is made
clear, as Jenzen writes of trans youth use of Tumblr and YouTube, has the ‘poten-
tial to aid transformation of the teenager’s bedroom into a civic and community
space.’ And the queering of such space, as seen in these articles, messes with
the neoliberal false promises of simplification, certainty, and fixity. What else is
there to do but to continue to mess with the project and, even, perhaps code
a new one?

The Economy’s Other Half78
with no kids also benefit from these investments without bearing the
same costs. There is a gender dimension to these distributive dynamics
when mothers disproportionately bear the costs of raising the next gen-
eration. These gender inequalities are intensified if, thanks to the design
of the pension scheme, women receive a lower payment because they
spent less time in paid employment and more time providing unpaid
care services.
As this book has argued, the costs of raising the next generation are
sizable. These costs are not fixed, they change over time, and expecta-
tions of these costs influence women’s decisions whether to have chil-
dren or not. There are numerous components to the cost of children.
Part of the costs involve direct spending – the money that goes towards
the children’s food, clothing, education, and healthcare, among other
expenditures. Unpaid care work represents another component of the
overall costs. Unpaid labour does not require a money exchange, but
it still represents a real cost in terms of economic resources. The time
spent caring for children could have been put to other uses, including
earning more income in paid employment.
The cost of children tends to rise with long-run economic growth
and development. For example, as average living standards increase, the
average level of educational attainment also tends to rise. Back in the
1950s, in a country like the US, a high school education was sufficient to
get a decent job. Now many parents expect that their children will attend
a college or university. The statistics speak for themselves. In 1950, 33
per cent of the US population aged 25 years or more had completed at
least four years of high school (14–18), but only 6 per cent had com-
pleted at least four years of higher education (college/university). In con-
trast, in 2017, 90 per cent had completed four years of high school and
34 per cent had completed four years of college. 9 This additional edu-
cation can be expensive. Greater investment in educational outcomes
increases the cost of raising a child to adulthood. Similarly, as wages and
salaries increase, the opportunity costs of spending time in unpaid work,
instead of paid employment, also grow. This further pushes up the cost
of children.

79Reimagining macro
Gender inequalities have an enormous impact on the cost of chil-
dren – and who ends up paying those costs? When women perform the
majority of unpaid care work, the opportunity cost of their labour, what
they could have earned in paid employment, becomes an important con-
tributor to the overall cost of children. Large inequalities in the labour
market, with women earning just a fraction of what men earn, effectively
lowers the costs of children when women are the ones doing most of the
unpaid care work. These kinds of pay gaps reinforce the gender division
of labour and entrench gender inequalities. If the goal is to keep the cost
of raising children low, it makes sense for women to specialize in unpaid
care work when there is a large gender pay gap. They give up less income
than a man would by focusing on unpaid rather than paid work.
This implies that improvements in women’s opportunities for paid
employment will tend to push up the cost of children. This is not neces-
sarily just a one-time cost involving more unpaid labour when the kids
are young. Women who take time off to have children may end up inter-
rupting their career tracks, and this can affect their long-run earnings
throughout the rest of their working lives (see, e.g., Blau & Kahn 2016;
Kleven, Landais & Søgaard 2018).
Women are the ones that have children, but their decision to do so
occurs within a complex social and economic environment. Putting
aside social norms that prescribe women’s role as one of childbearing,
raising a child on one’s own is an expensive proposition. It is not surpris-
ing that women often have children within some kind of partnership,
such as a marriage or cohabitating arrangement. Pooling labour allows
one partner, often a man, to specialize in paid employment while the
other spends more time doing unpaid work. Forming a household also
saves money. Two adults can live together in a single house or apart-
ment. They do not need separate residences. They can cook together and
share household durables, such as a car, a stove or a washing machine.
Because of this, average costs per person of maintaining a family are
lower the more people, adults and children, live under one roof – as
long as they share, at least to some extent, their resources (Folbre 2008).
These economies of scale make it less costly to raise children in some
form of partnership than it would for a mother to do it alone.

The Economy’s Other Half80
However, there are potential downsides to women having children
within a partnership. Men may be in a stronger position than women
when it comes to making decisions about how economic resources are
used. In other words, men have a stronger bargaining position. Consider
two-person “breadwinner” households, in which men do paid work and
earn all the income and women specialize in unpaid household work.
Since men earn the household’s income, they may have more influence
on how it is used. Women who do only unpaid work have limited exit
options. If they leave their partners, how will they earn the income
needed for themselves and their children? When women lack a strong
fallback position, it weakens their bargaining power.
How does bargaining power influence the distribution of the costs of
children? Raising children in a two-adult (or more) household lowers the
costs of children, for the reasons already discussed. But those costs may
be unequally shared, with women bearing more of those costs than men.
This increases the costs to women of having children, although perhaps
not enough to make women want to go it alone and raise their children
themselves. When there is unequal bargaining power, men’s share of the
costs of having children will likely be reduced. They enjoy the benefits
of knowing that there will be a next generation without paying the same
price as women.
There is another risk with forming a household and having children
within a partnership. Marriages and other cohabitating relationships
do not necessarily last forever. When they collapse, it is common for
women to take primary responsibility for the children. The benefits of
sharing these costs, and the economies of scale associated with having a
multiple-adult household, evaporate. Because of this, the costs of chil-
dren increase and a large part of the burden of higher costs falls on the
mothers. A system that enforces child support payments would help to
offset the rise in costs, but such payments are not always forthcoming
and enforcement may be weak. Because of this, the costs of children to
women will likely rise when there is a fall in the likelihood that marriages
and other partnerships will last.
All of this means that single-mothers are likely to be, on average, more
vulnerable than women who raise children in other arrangements. This

83Reimagining macro
Yet the institutions and arrangements that support the reproduc-
tion of society and the long-run sustainability of the economy are not
always just or fair. This is reflected, for example, in women’s unequal
burden of unpaid work, a major source of structural inequality. And so
we come full circle to where this book began. Economic policies and
institutions have gender specific effects because they interact with and,
at times, reinforce existing structural sources of inequality. A more equi-
table macroeconomics would need to not only acknowledge, but assist
in transforming, these underlying inequalities.

May I tell a story? I have no idea whether it is true. It is the third

Saint Petersburg. Trotsky comes running in and says, “Kronstadt has
been taken! We are lost!” Or whatever he said. And Lenin answers,
“It doesn’t matter! We existed for three days!” That’s what I mean.
It won’t be carried to completion, but we are a generation that sees

Commentary on the impact of September 11 on academic criticism
has become something of a cliché. Nevertheless, I cannot but note that
events in this decade led me to shift my research focus from the mod-
ern colonial archives to the political, economic, and media systems of
the contemporary moment. For a time, I thought this book was a con-
sequence of my having moved to Southern California in the summer of
2001, but I have come to understand that it is the result not only of my
immersion in the IT-rich environment of California but also of my years
at the University of Minnesota, where the faculty and students work-
ing in the area of contemporary cultural studies and theory are without
equal.
Katherine Hayles has been a great supporter of my work, and I can
only gesture toward a complete acknowledgment of all that is owed her.
I am also hugely indebted to Mark Poster and Doug Armato both for
championing this book for the series and keeping an eye on its prog-
ress. For more than a decade, I have worked under the conscious and un-
conscious influence of Alan Liu as he was writing his magisterial study
of knowledge work, The Laws of Cool. It goes without saying that Alan
continues to give voice to many of my ideas and helps me bring them
into being. So, too, Russell Samolsky has been collaborator and combat-
ant; without his input this book would have taken a very different form
indeed.
Thanks to the following for contributions that range from careful
reading to general advice and reading suggestions: Carl Gutiérrez-Jones,
Philip Armstrong, Julian Stallabrass, Karen Steigman, Jennifer Jones,

Why save the world when we can design it?
—SerpicaNaro
There is much in the world to protest. The pressing question, particu-
larly for a generation schooled in intellectual history by those who be-
lieved in revolution and had in fact stormed the barricades, is this: how
does one express dissent and conceive of revolutionary transformation
while distancing oneself from one’s forebears, whose lingering nostalgia
for their own storming of the barricades, not to mention their idealistic
belief in the possibility of visible and permanent social change, seems
quaint, if even a trifle embarrassing? Of course, the Battle of Seattle
caught the world by surprise. Antiglobalization, WTO, and G8 protests
have been nothing if not spectacular, starkly defined spatial and tem-
poral events. So, too, were the street demonstrations in support of U.S.
immigrant rights in the spring of 2006. But the fact remains that the
doxa about the value, cultural significance, and efficacy of the streets
has changed. This is less an objective than a subjective truth, a truth of
perception, a general impression of a shared sensibility. It is precisely
this change in sensibility that politically engaged new media art projects
negotiate. As we will see in the pages that follow, Critical Art Ensemble’s
suggestion that “the streets are dead capital” informs their theses about
the work, and the targets, of tactical media. Critical Art Ensemble (CAE)
argues that the shift in revolutionary investments corresponds with a
shift in the nature of power, which has removed itself from the streets
and become nomadic. Activism and dissent, in turn, must, and do, enter
the network, as we will see from the new media art projects I address in
this book. These projects are not oriented toward the grand, sweeping
revolutionary event; rather, they engage in a micropolitics of disruption,
intervention, and education.

iNtroductioN2
Josh On and Futurefarmers’ They Rule (2001/2004) affords us an ex-
ample of a new media work that is at once aesthetic design, intellectual
investigation, and political activism. 1 A work of tactical cartography,
They Rule affords users the ability to visualize the myriad and intricate
connections among Fortune 100 corporations and directors. Users can
choose from a list of institutions, people, and companies and build their
own maps from the data the artists have compiled from SEC filings and
public Web sites. Or they can view the archived maps that powerfully
document the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of “the ten
richest people” and “the magnificent seven.”
By rendering economic and political complexity in the form of a basic
cartography, They Rule strives to make legible the kind of behind-the-
scenes loyalties and corporate collusions that drive public policy. Fur-
ther, its use of simple, monochromatic icons and geometric lines sug-
gests that “design” as such is constituted by the architecture of corporate
power. With Mark Lombardi’s graphite- on-paper drawings, Michael
Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11, and Craig Unger’s House of Bush, House of Saud
as precedents, the maps voted most popular tend to be those that trace
the degrees of separation from, variously, the Bush family, Dick Cheney,
Harken Energy, and Halliburton. 2 Tactical maps such as these do not
offer the omniscient point of view we associate with Cartesian carto-
graphic practice; in that they are individually tailored and produced,
they are fundamentally subjective. They Rule in particular embodies a
sense of bottom-up resistance: it may map the top- down power relations,
but it does so in a manner and style we have come to associate with cul-
tural dissent and oppositionality. See what I have made, the tactical user
says. See how I try to manage the ties that bind and produce me. It may
be a hollow laugh at power, but it is still a laugh, the enjoyment at once
solitary and shared, for, as the list of “hot” or favored maps on the site
indicates, They Rule forges a social bond and a political consciousness
held in common. 3
Oil politics are even more directly at the fore in Michael Mandiberg’s
Oil Standard, a Firefox plug-in that uses real-time pricing informa-
tion in the dynamic conversion of U.S. dollars into barrels of crude oil. 4

Publication loaded464International Journal of Cultural Studies 20(5)it involves a type of extrajudicial citizen surveillance. These offline enterprises are, how-ever, inextricably integrated with online vigilantism given that the results are circulated primarily via social media platforms and blogs.Like  vigilantism,  digilantism  can  be  ethically  justified  in  some  contexts.  Paul  H  Robinson’s argument is that while vigilantism cannot, by definition, be legally justified, it can be morally justified in cases where society fails to ‘hold up its end of the social contract’ (2015: 401, 405). Persuasive defences have also been made for feminist vigi-lantism, given the systemic and oppressive gender inequity faced by women across many territories and jurisdictions (see Sen, 2012; White and Rastogi, 2014). Digilantism does, however, have risks as well as benefits. Ethical issues arise given the potential for digi-lantism  to  involve  bad  actors,  lynch  mobs,  scapegoating,  mistaken  identities,  and  the  infliction  of  punishment  that  is  disproportionate  to  or  greater  than  the  original  crime  (Jane, 2016, 2017). Naming and shaming is potentially ethically problematic because of the risk of the sorts of aggressive, metastasising cyber mobs identified by Jon Ronson (2015) and Danielle Keats Citron (2014).Digilantism can also have uncertain results in that it may alienate, divide, or be invis-ible to the broader public and the powers-that-be, resulting in activism that is not condu-cive  to  the  sought-after  social  and/or  institutional  changes.  Conversely,  the  actions  of  digilantes may be so impressive that outsiders form the view that no other interventions are  required.  For  example,  the  media  applause  frequently  given  to  feminist  digilantes  may  fortify  extrajudicial  cultures  online  in  cases  where  institutional  remedies  would  arguably be more useful (Jane, 2016, 2017). Like other forms of vigilantism, the offline vigilantism  around  manspreading  may  put  activists  in  danger.  For  instance,  anti-manspreading  feminists  who  engage  in  embodied  activism  on  public  transport  could  potentially  suffer  injury  if  any  of  the  men  they  confront  or  photograph  respond  with  force.  (This  is  not  to  argue  that  activism  involving  physical  danger  should  always  be  avoided; it is simply an acknowledgement of the potential risk.)When  appraising  the  efficacy  and  ethics  of  the  anti-manspreading  campaigns,  it  is  useful to consider feminists’ use of the edgy, participatory humour that has become so popular in digital cultures. ‘Manspreading’ is one of a number of wry feminist portman-teaus used to draw attention – primarily via the cybersphere – to sexist practices involv-ing  what  is  perceived  to  be  men’s  inflated  sense  of  entitlement.  Similar  terms  include  ‘mansplaining’,2 ‘manslamming’,3 ‘manterrupting’,4 and ‘bropriating’.5 The playfulness – but also the pointed nature – of these neologisms chimes with a number of more gen-eral  characteristics  of  the  way  humour  works  online.  While  making  broad  generalisa-tions about internet humour obviously risks homogenising a richly heterogeneous genre, it has been observed that humour online often involves absurdity, profanity, word play, sarcasm, jokes at others’ expenses, in-group gags, pranks, competitiveness, playfulness, irony, transgression, re-mixes, virality, and so on (see Phillips, 2015; Stryker, 2011).The origins of internet humour with the aforementioned characteristics can be tracked back to subcultural trolling communities such as those active on websites such as 4chan (Phillips,  2015;  Stryker,  2011).  The  humour  involved  in  feminist  anti-manspreading  activism, however, varies markedly from the hunt for ‘lulz’6 associated with trolls.7 Anti-manspreading humour, for example, is putatively underpinned by social justice concerns, whereas a signal characteristic of online humour in male-dominated subcultural trolling Jane 465communities includes a vehement rejection of what are dismissed as ‘social justice war-riors’ (SJWs). That trolls’ avowed enemies – feminist SJWs – are appropriating elements of troll humour to use back against men is ironic, and constitutes a meta dimension of the activism.  That  said,  humour  involving  the  ridicule  or  abuse  of  identifiable  individuals  raises  ethical  issues  if  it  involves  the  sort  of  ‘gleeful  savagery’  Ronson  (2015)  has  observed  vis-à-vis  the  punishment  of  transgressors  via  online  public  shaming.  These  processes  of  appropriation  and  re-appropriation  are  also  endless  and  can  just  as  easily  turn  against  feminists.  For  example,  a  search  of  ‘#manspreading’  on  Twitter  includes  photographic celebrations as well as criticisms of the practice.It can be seen, therefore, that the use of humour in the anti-manspreading campaign is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the catchy portmanteau and wry feminist commen-tary helps explain the viral popularity of manspreading content. On the other hand, the participatory meme culture that has become a hallmark of contemporary digital cultures (Phillips, 2015: 137) means that manspreading hashtags and image galleries are continu-ally  being  subverted  –  sometimes  simply  in  pursuit  of  further  humour.  Know  Your  Meme’s  tracking  of  the  spread  of  the  manspreading  meme  points  to  the  Tumblr  blogs  One Bro, Two Seats and also Saving Room for Cats, both of which feature photographs of manspreaders with absurd images digitally inserted into the gaps between their legs. This drift away from feminism and towards whimsy is also obvious in the ‘catspreading’ meme which features felines in variously splayed poses.Feminist activism around manspreading can be deemed as having achieved success at the  awareness-raising  level.  The  term,  the  phenomenon,  and  the  feminist  digilante  responses continue to generate a great deal of international mainstream and social media coverage  ranging  from  extremely  positive  to  extremely  negative.  The  valence  of  this  coverage  is  perhaps  not  as  important  as  its  role  in  assisting  feminist  efforts  to  propel  awareness of the term and the practice of manspreading into mainstream consciousness. In  2015,  for  instance,  the  word  ‘manspreading’  was  added  to  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary. In the same year, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) launched  a  commuter  civility  campaign  which  included  a  series  of  posters  reading,  ‘Dude ... Stop the Spread, Please. It’s a space issue.’ These featured a stylised image of a  man  sitting  with  his  legs  splayed  over  several  seats  while  other  commuters  stood.  Institutions  in  other  US  cities  –  as  well  as  the  Toronto  Transit  Authority  –  also  began  encouraging male passengers to sit with their legs closed (Uffalussy, 2014).Counter-responses from men’s rights activistsMen’s rights activists8 have protested bitterly about the feminist anti-manspreading cam-paign from its earliest days, with the MTA campaign spurring some of the most hostile and vitriolic discourse. While feminist claims about both the practice of and the power signifiers involved in manspreading find support in a range of scholarly literature, most of the men’s rights activist counter-claims have dubious truth value. The most prominent counter-argument is that men need to sit widely in order to ensure their genital safety and comfort. This claim is entirely unsupported by the medical literature. Michael Eisenberg, an assistant professor of urology at the Stanford School of Medicine, for instance, told journalists that – barring recent scrotile or penile surgery – there is no medical reason for Jane 467obscene overtones’ and constitutes a gender-based slur (2015). Another blogger argues that the SJW battle against manspreading shows feminism is not only dead but in a state of rancid decomposition:About  three  days  after  death,  corpses  really  start  to  stink.  After  rigor  and  livor  mortis,  the  body’s cells start to rupture – what’s commonly known as putrefaction. This horrific interstitial stage of decomposition is where the unhappy modern feminist movement currently finds itself: emitting noxious odours, but well on the way to decay and skeletonisation, long past the point where  CPR  would  have  any  effect  on  the  brain.  For  feminism,  skeletonisation  cannot  come  soon enough. (Yiannopoulos, 2014).The tenor of this discourse is revealing. If we take Davies’ ‘Fuck You, Dudes’ piece as the approximate beginning of the manspreading debate, it can be seen that, from the outset, the tone of some key feminist players was combative, profane, and emotive. The response  from  men’s  rights  activists,  meanwhile,  was  similarly  pitched  and  involved  comparable strategic moves in terms of the deployment of naming and shaming digilan-tism, ad hominems, sarcasm, narky humour, and so on. Such mimetic ‘doubling’ is theo-rised by René Girard, who argues that antagonism is both predicated on and generative of a type of mirroring where combatants increasingly come to resemble each other (1986: 42–7). This type of escalating mimetic antagonism is common in online disputes, where often the point does not seem to be about winning an argument via engaging with others’ propositions,  so  much  as  increasing  discursive  volume  in  order  to  out-shout  everyone  else (Jane, 2014).As such, a number of interesting problematics arise in relation to the manspreading case  study,  as  well  as  in  relation  to  conflictual  cyber  discourse  more  generally.  For  instance: What is the significance of online debate in which interlocutors are emotional (rather than detached and deliberative), abusive (instead of calmly civil), and seemingly less interested in deploying coherent reasoning so much as ‘winning’ at all costs? Does escalating, mimetic antagonism result in the hardening of opposing views instead of (or at least alongside of) a productive outcome? Or is the exchange itself the only outcome required? And what insights, if any, are available here for feminist activists? In the next section  of  this  article,  I  will  show  that  agonistic  theory’s  emphasis  on  affect,  power,  ineradicable conflict, and shifting hegemonies seems to offer a fruitful theoretical frame-work for beginning to answer these questions, but that there are limits to its usefulness.Agonistic theory and the internet‘Agonistic pluralism’ is Mouffe’s term for a form of radical democracy which recognises that  conflict  and  confrontation  are  not  only  a  productive  and  permanent  part  of  political  conflict, but are necessary conditions for politics to exist at all. While Mouffe herself has expressed some ambivalence about the agonistic possibilities of new media platforms (cited in Carpentier and Cammaerts, 2006), a number of thinkers have used her work to argue that online scenes of exclusion, dispute, vitriol, and ‘hating’ are exemplars of the types of pas-sionate  public  spaces  Mouffe  sees  as  constituting  deep  democracy  (see  McCosker,  2014;  McCosker and Johns, 2013; Neumayer and Svensson, 2014; Shaw, 2012; Tong, 2015).472International Journal of Cultural Studies 20(5)FundingThis  work  was  supported  by  the  Australian  Research  Council  under  Discovery  Early  Career  Research Award Grant DE150100670.Notes  1.  The  search  terms  used  during  the  data  collection  phase  of  the  manspreading  study  were  ‘manspread’, ‘manspreading’, ‘manspreader’, ‘digilantism’, ‘online vigilantism’, and ‘internet vigilantism’.  2. ‘Mansplaining’ refers to men who offer women patronising explanations of topics of which they are likely to have prior and/or expert knowledge.  3. ‘Manslamming’ refers to male pedestrians who collide with people who get in their way.  4. ‘Manterrupting’ refers to the unnecessary and patronising interruption of a woman by a man.  5. ‘Bropriating’ refers to a man thieving and taking credit for a woman’s ideas.  6. ‘Lulz’, a corruption of ‘Laugh Out Loud’ (LOL), is ‘a cornerstone of trolling humor and cul-ture’ and involves unapologetic schadenfreude (Phillips, 2015: 27).  7. Here I am using the term ‘troll’ to refer to members of the types of subcultural trolling com-munities researched by Whitney Phillips (2015).  8. My use of the term ‘feminists’ and ‘men’s rights activists’ in this article is not to suggest a neat split between women on one side and men on the other, as there are male commentators who have spoken in support of anti-manspreading activism and female commentators who have spoken against it.  9. ‘Creepshots’ is a slang term used to describe non-consensual, sexualised photos usually taken by men of women.10.  ‘Revenge  porn’  refers  to  the  uploading  of  sexually  explicit  material  –  usually  of  a  former  female partner – without the consent of the pictured subject.ReferencesAlfred C (2014) In Turkey, women shame male passengers with ‘close your legs’ Twitter Campaign.

Introduction
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.
The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:
natural information such as text, images, and sounds
code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.
WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards are stable and referenceable; they do not change after they are published.
WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008.
WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018.
WCAG 2.2 Draft is scheduled to be finalized in early 2023. More information is in What’s New in WCAG 2.2 Draft.
All requirements (“success criteria”) from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1.
All requirements in 2.0 and 2.1 will be included in 2.2. The wording of the 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria will be exactly the same in 2.2.
There are additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1.
The proposed new success criteria in 2.2 are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.2 Draft.
Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0.
And content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 will also conform to 2.1 and 2.0. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don’t need to bother looking at 2.0. (Same for WCAG 2.2 when is it done.)
WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies.
Who WCAG is for
WCAG is for those who want a technical standard. It is not an introduction to accessibility. For links to introductory material, see “Where should I start?” in the FAQ.
WCAG is primarily intended for:
Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.)
Web authoring tool developers
Web accessibility evaluation tool developers
Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility
To meet the needs of others — including policy makers, managers, and researchers — there are many different WAI Resources.
What is in WCAG 2
The WCAG standards have 12-13 guidelines. The guidelines are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
For each guideline, there are testable success criteria. The success criteria are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.
The success criteria are what determine “conformance” to WCAG. That is, in order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria. Details are in the Conformance section of WCAG.
For a short summary of the WCAG 2 guidelines, see WCAG 2.1 at a Glance.

Introduction: “And Now, You
Have Got Our Attention”
On July 29, 2007, an entity calling itself Anonymous—
unknown, at the time, to all except the most erudite
Internet denizens—uploaded a video to YouTube. A
metallic, digital tone thrums as a headless suited man appears
over a blank background. A male voice begins to speak
through the interference: “Dear Fox News,” it intones.1
 The
news organization had recently devoted a segment entirely
to a group they described as “the Internet Hate Machine”—
a title the collective would subsequently adopt as a badge
of honor.
But for a collective that revels in trickery and guile, to
simply laugh and dismiss such an exposé would be to miss
a great opportunity. And so, the disturbingly ponderous,
down-pitched voice of Anonymous continues: “The name and
nature of Anonymous has been ravaged, as if it were a whore
in a back alley, and then placed on display for the public eye to
behold. Allow me to say quite simply: you completely missed
the point of who and what we are … We are everyone and we
are no one … We are the face of chaos and the harbingers of
judgment. We laugh at the face of tragedy. We mock those in
pain. We ruin the lives of others simply because we can … A
man takes out his aggression on a cat, we laugh. Hundreds
die in a plane crash, we laugh. We are the embodiment of 
2 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
humanity with no remorse, no caring, no love, and no sense
of morality.”
The video ends, “YOU … HAVE NOW GOT … OUR
ATTENTION.”
They certainly got mine—soon after the video’s publication, I became entangled in a multi-year research project on
the collective that I have only now just twisted my way out
of (this book monumentalizes that struggle). The video was
meant to satirize Fox News’s hyperbolic characterization of
Anonymous as the ultimate purveyors of Internet pranking
and trolling, “hackers on steroids,” as Fox had called them.
And yet, the creepy sentiments and chilling style captured the
trolls’ terrifying side perfectly; instead of overturning Fox
News’s ridiculously one-dimensional portrayal, the video
seemingly confirmed it to the utmost—though only, of course,
to those not in on the joke.
This double meaning captures the dark humor of Anonymous
(the lulz, they call it) in a nutshell. The lulz—a deviant style
of humor and a quasi-mystical state of being—has, as we will
see, evolved with Anonymous from the beginning. And there
was a time when spreading lulzy mayhem was all Anonymous
seemed interested in. But not long after this parodic and bombastic video, Anons could be found at the heart of hundreds
of political “ops”—becoming integral, even, to some of the
most compelling political struggles of our age. In solidarity
with Tunisian protesters, Anonymous hacked the Tunisian
government’s websites in January 2011; months later, Spain’s
indignados beamed the collective’s signature Guy Fawkes
mask onto a building in the Puerta del Sol; and Anons disseminated some of the first calls to occupy Wall Street.
By then the collective had established itself as a social,
political force with a series of ops that remain some of its
most memorable. In 2008, adherents to a new vision for
Anonymous took Scientology to task after the litigious organization attempted to censor a famous video of Tom Cruise.
Germinated for the sake of the lulz, Anons both realized 
their power to impact global struggles and the pleasure such
engagements could provide. Anonymous became even more
widely known two years later in December 2010, the result
of “Operation Avenge Assange.” Initiated by AnonOps, one
of the collective’s more militant and prolific nodes, Anons
engaged in digital direct action by launching a distributed
denial of service (DDoS) campaign. This tactic, which disrupts access to webpages by flooding them with tidal waves of
requests, was directed against financial institutions that had
refused to process donations to WikiLeaks, including PayPal
and MasterCard. With each operation Anonymous was further
emboldened.
And yet, even after Anonymous drifted away from ungovernable trolling pandemonium to engage in the global
political sphere, whenever people scrutinized its activist
interventions—whether in a street protest or a high-profile
computer intrusion—a question always seemed to loom: are
Anonymous and its adherents principled dissidents? Or are
they simply kids screwing around on the Internet as lulzdrunk trolls?
This confusion is eminently understandable. Beyond a foundational commitment to the maintenance of anonymity and a
broad dedication to the free flow of information, Anonymous
has no consistent philosophy or political program. While
increasingly recognized for its digital dissent and direct
action, Anonymous has never displayed a predictable trajectory. Given that Anonymous’s ancestry lies in the sometimes
humorous, frequently offensive, and at times deeply invasive
world of Internet trolling—the core logic of which seems, at
least at first glance, to be inhospitable to the cultivation of
activist sensibilities and politicized endeavors—it is remarkable that the name Anonymous became a banner seized by
political activists in the first place.

From Trolling to the Misfits of Activism
Today the broad deployment of both Anonymous’s Guy
Fawkes mask and the ideas it came to stand for among demonstrators occupying Tahrir Square and Polish politicians
sitting in parliamentary chambers seem absurd when we
consider the collective’s origins. Before 2008, the moniker
Anonymous was used almost exclusively for what one Anon
describes as “Internet motherfuckery.” Anonymous, birthed in
the pits of 4chan’s random bulletin board /b/ (often regarded
as the “asshole of the Internet”), was a name synonymous
with trolling: an activity that seeks to ruin the reputations of
individuals and organizations and reveal embarrassing and
personal information. Trolls try to upset people by spreading
grisly or disturbing content, igniting arguments, or engendering general bedlam. The chaos of feuding and flaming can be
catalyzed by inhabiting identities, beliefs, and values solely
for their mischievous potential; by invading online forums
with spam; or by ordering hundreds of pizzas, taxis, and even
SWAT teams to a target’s residence. Whatever the technique,
trolls like to say they do what they do for the lulz—a spirited
but often malevolent brand of humor etymologically derived
from lol.
One early Anonymous trolling raid—legendary to this
day—set its sights on a virtual platform, called Habbo Hotel,
whose tag line enthusiastically beckons, “Make friends, join
the fun, get noticed!” A Finnish environment geared toward
teenagers, it encourages visitors to create cutesy, Lego-style
avatars who can socialize together in the hotel and customize guest rooms with “furni.” On July 6, 2006, Anonymous
logged onto the site in droves—presenting themselves, all, as
black men in gray suits with prominent afros. By navigating
just so, they were able to collectively assemble into human
swastikas and picket lines, both of which prevented regular
Habbo members (children, mostly) from entering the hotel’s
pool. Anyone attempting to understand the reasons for these 
actions was informed by the mustachioed characters that the
pool was closed “due to fail and AIDS.”
A couple of year’s after the first Habbo Raids, and a mere
six months after they had been labeled the “Internet Hate
Machine,” certain Anons began using the name and some
associated iconography—headless men in black suits, in
particular—to coordinate political protests. This surprising
metamorphosis sprouted from what many consider to be
one of Anonymous’s most legendary trolling provocations:
targeting the Church of Scientology. “In a previously unseen
way,” noted one participant in the raids, “the greater Anon
community united to unleash a hearty load of fuck you upon
Scientology’s entire cult empire.”2
 Impelled by the lulz—by
the desire to release an avalanche of hilarious and terrifying
mischief—thousands boarded the troll train, christened
“Project Chanology,” to launch DDoS attacks on Scientology
websites, order unpaid pizzas and escorts to Scientology
churches across North America, fax images of nude body
parts to churches, and propel a barrage of phone pranks, most
notably against the Dianetics hotlines designed to offer advice
regarding the “first truly workable technology of the mind.”
Like most previous raids, many expected this hearty “fuck
you” would run its course and then peter out after a few days
of brutal and playful shenanigans. But a short video made by
a small group of participants—concocted for the lulz alone—
ignited a serious debate within the rank and file of Anonymous.
The video “declared war” on the Church: “For the good of
your followers, for the good of mankind—and for our own
enjoyment—we shall proceed to expel you from the Internet
and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its
present form.”3 This ironic declaration of war spurred individuals into debate and then catapulted them onto the streets. On
February 10, 2008, over seven thousand people in 127 cities
protested the Church of Scientology’s human rights abuses
and acts of censorship.
Anonymous thus shifted from (as one participating Anon
Introduction 5
6 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
later explained to my class) “ultracoordinated motherfuckery”
to the dissemination of incriminating facts about Scientology.
They also forged bonds with an older generation of dissidents
already at work highlighting the Church’s abuses. Trolling had
given way to an earnest activist endeavor, as if Anonymous had
emerged from its online sanctuary and set out to improve the
world. Over the next two years, some Anonymous members
would hatch unrelated activist subgroups, and many participants came to identify themselves as bona fide activists, albeit
with a transgressive twist.
Many of Anonymous’s actions, like creating the publicity
videos that have become a vernacular institution unto themselves, are entirely legal. But a subset of tactics—notably
DDoS attacks and hacks—are illegal: criminal offenses under
all circumstances, at least in the United States. Government
officials have thus made various attempts to slot a class of
its activities under the umbrella term of “cyberwarfare,” and
prosecute its participants accordingly. The epitome of this
maneuver occurred on February 21, 2012, when the Wall
Street Journal reported that General Keith Alexander, then
director of the United States National Security Agency (NSA),
had briefed officials at the White House in secret meetings. He
claimed Anonymous “could have the ability within the next
year or two to bring about a limited power outage through a
cyberattack.”4
As the Wall Street Journal article ricocheted across social
media platforms, questions were raised. Did this claim strike
anyone as believable? Just what exactly constituted the
“ability” to bring about a power outage? What would be an
appropriate response if this were true? It is unlikely that we will
ever find out whether the NSA’s assessment was based on credible intelligence or whether it was meant simply to smear and
discredit Anonymous. Either way, General Alexander’s claim
succeeded, at least momentarily, in portraying Anonymous as
a menace akin to Islamic jihadists and the communist threat
of yesteryear.
Ultimately, it proved unconvincing. Anonymous, for all its
varied tactics—both legal and illegal, online and offline—has
never been known to publicly call for such an attack. And
there is no evidence to suggest that it would so much as
entertain the idea. Endangering human lives has never been
a topic of discussion among members, even during the most
helter-skelter of chat room and message board conversations.
Subsequent news reports quoted activists and security experts
who dismissed the NSA’s claims as “fear-mongering.”5
Even though a tactic like this would be entirely out of character for Anonymous, the group’s relationship with the court
of public opinion remains ambivalent. Anonymous’s methods
are at times subversive, often rancorous, usually unpredictable, and frequently disdainful of etiquette or the law. Take
“doxing”: the leaking of private information—such as Social
Security numbers, home addresses, or personal photos—
resides in a legal gray zone because some of the information
released can be found on publicly accessible websites.
A single Anonymous operation might integrate all three
modes—legal, illegal, and legally gray tactics—and if there is
an opportunity to infuse an operation with the lulz as well,
someone will. A prime example is Operation BART from
August 2011. Anonymous was spurred into action when San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officials sought
to disable mobile phone reception on station platforms to
thwart a planned anti–police brutality march. Local activists
had called for the demonstration to protest the fatal shooting
of Charles Hill, an unarmed passenger. Incensed by transportation authorities’ meddling in democratic expression,
Anonymous helped organize a series of street demonstrations
soon after.
A couple of individuals hacked into BART’s computers and
released customer data in order to garner media attention.
Someone also found a racy, semi-nude photo of BART’s official spokesperson, Linton Johnson, on his personal website.
The photo was republished on the “bartlulz” website along
Introduction 7

with this brazen rationalization: “if you are going to be a dick
to the public, then I’m sure you don’t mind showing your dick
to the public.” Sometimes coy and playful, sometimes serious
and inspiring, often all at once (as OpBART demonstrated
so well), even to this day, these activist tricksters are still animated by a collective will toward mischief—toward the lulz.
“I did it for the lulz”
Does Anonymous’s ongoing embrace of lulzy mischief mean
that researching them was a merry and lighthearted affair, the
essence of an anthropological joyride? Looking for insights
into Anonymous’s surprising metamorphosis from trolling
misfits to the misfits of activism, I began an anthropological study of the group in 2008. At first my research was low
key, straightforward, and lighthearted. I attended protests
and followed discussions on web forums and on Internet
Relay Chat (IRC)—one of the most important communication applications for Anonymous (and many other geeks
and hackers).
In 2011, as Anonymous grew more tentacles and activists initiated dozens of political operations, this side project
became my life. For over two years I was constantly jacked
in, online for a minimum of five hours a day, struggling to
keep abreast of all the simultaneous operations, some of
them hidden from my view due to their clandestine nature.
Researching Anonymous felt like following a thread through a
dark and twisty path strewn with rumors, lies, secrets, and the
ghoulish reality of spies and informants. The journey has been
marked by soaring thrills, disappointing dead ends, and moral
pretzels—wherein seemingly intractable ethical conundrums
coexist easily with clear-cut examples of inspirational risk and
sacrifice. Beyond the consequences of its actions, Anonymous’s
organizational structure itself felt similarly convoluted and
bewildering. Over time, it became clear: Anonymous was not 
simply a maze, with a structure and escape route revealed in
a view from above; Anonymous was a far more complicated
and tangled warren. This was no static labyrinth, like the
one built by Daedalus to house the Minotaur. It was an infinite machine operating a tight recursive loop wherein mazes
generated maze-generating mazes.
In spite of the difficulties I faced when traversing this maze,
I gradually became acquainted with Anonymous, and it with
me, sometimes on a personal level. As an anthropologist does,
I watched, listened, interviewed, debated, questioned, and
prodded. At times I even participated, so long as my involvement was legal. My tasks were many: editing manifestos,
teaching reporters how to find Anonymous, and correcting
misinformation.
My level of engagement was limited by self-imposed and
external barriers. The anthropological imperative requires a
certain degree of distance, while at the same time compelling
one to delve deep. The trick is to integrate and go beyond
simply relying on participants’ explanations of events. I was
sympathetic to many of Anonymous’s tactics and causes, but
not all of them. Moral quandaries of various sorts created
critical distance. Due to the illegal nature of some activities,
certain areas were off limits. This was better for Anonymous,
and for me. Later, after arrests and convictions, I was able to
learn retrospectively about hidden acts.
With the ascendancy of militant tactics among a new group
of Anons, the stakes had changed by the summer of 2011.
Anonymous began targeting Fortune 500 corporations and
military defense contractors. Mercenary hackers doxed Anons,
revealing their identities to law enforcement by publishing
their legal names, personal photos, and addresses. Anons
started to leak sensitive, classified, or humiliating information.
At this juncture, the FBI got involved. And no matter how
much Anonymous injected lulz into an op, humor could not
stop the spread of a gut-wrenching unease among participants
and observers of the group. So even if researching Anonymous
Introduction 9
10 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
was often a thrill, and certainly always an adventure, it ultimately made me paranoid.
This was a deep paranoia that hovered over everything like
a barometric disturbance before a tornado. It felt justified,
but that might be just the paranoia talking. While researching
Anonymous, it was imperative that I keep law enforcement
away from me, and from my data. Crossing a border meant
days of preparation to secure my notes and put together a
safe travel computer. Questioning by authorities always felt
imminent; it wasn‘t a question of if the G-men would visit,
but when. Vigilance was necessary to protect my sources. I
reminded Anonymous participants that they needed to be
careful what they told me. I never sat in on their private
channels as they were planning illegal operations.
As for the government, I was hiding in plain sight. By no
means was I anonymous. That was the irony: I gave talks
about Anonymous, I was interviewed by over 150 reporters,
and I routinely discussed Anonymous on radio and television.
As a scholar teaching at a prominent university, I was easy
to find. On occasion, high-level corporate executives from
some of the world’s most powerful companies even reached
out, calling me personally in the hope that I could offer some
nugget of insight about an entity many of them had grown
to fear.
A recurring nightmare haunted me for years. Intelligence
agents hammered on my door. I would jolt upright in bed, my
heart pounding: “They’re here.” It was just like Poltergeist,
except the bed wasn’t shaking and the demonic possession left
as soon as I sat up.
One day in 2012, I washed away the remaining threads of
my turbulent slumber with a strong cup of coffee, putting the
nightmare in the background for another day. With my brain
fully booted, I realized that today, April 19, the roles would
be reversed: today I would be knocking on the doors of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Canadian 
equivalent of the CIA. With a mixture of trepidation, ambivalence, and especially curiosity, I had accepted CSIS’s invitation
to give a lecture about Anonymous. I went to discover what
CSIS thought about Anonymous—did they view them as a
terrorist threat, a band of rambunctious/rabid activists, or
something else entirely? My secret agenda was to test their
reaction to the lulz: could an agency that manages matters of
national security bring itself to see the humor in Anonymous?
To find out, I concocted a simple lulz litmus test.
CSIS is headquartered in the outskirts of Canada’s capital,
Ottawa, in a large anodyne cream-colored building with teal
accents. I arrived alone by taxi, awash in thoughts of Orwell,
Brazil, Huxley, Kafka, and Bush/Obama’s total surveillance. I
asked myself, What am I doing here? What lies in the shadows
behind the walls of Canada’s spy agency? Could it be as bad
as I am imagining? Do they have high-tech surveillance rooms
like in Minority Report? Do they conduct psychological experiments in sterile, steel-lined interrogation rooms?
Adjusting my ill-fitting business suit, I forced myself to think
that inside were boring office cubicles with people pushing
paper and scheduling meetings destined for drab conference
rooms with a speaker phones in the middle of their tables.
Maybe there was a passive aggressive note taped to the refrigerator in the break room because someone ate all of the Tim
Horton’s sugary Timbits that were for the going-away party
later that day. A water-stained note over the sink with the
words, Your mother doesn’t work here, you will have to clean
up after yourself! It will be fine, I told myself.
To minimize my angst, I had promised myself I would offer
nothing new or secret, sticking to what was already public
and donating my modest honorarium to a civil liberties organization. But despite having given this same lecture dozens of
times, I walked through the front door feeling more diminutive than my five-foot self. A woman with a suit greeted me.
Everything felt unremarkable; there was nothing ominous in
sight, just bland office plants.
Introduction 11
12 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
I was brought to a room with a small stage. The atmosphere
was tense. I couldn’t discern the expression on anyone’s face.
I was nearly paralyzed with dread. Then, I worried that my
nervousness was going to make me say something I shouldn’t.
These agents, after all, were exceedingly well trained in the
art of information extraction; they would take advantage
of any weakness or opportunity to gain an advantage. With
over forty people staring at me, the atmosphere of seriousness
felt like it was burning right through my suit. Nevertheless,
I’d done this so many times that I was on autopilot, and it
wasn’t until ten minutes into my talk that I noticed my hands
shaking slightly as I attempted to click the play button on my
computer, in order to fire up my lulz litmus test: the famous
viral video made by Anonymous that had ignited their revolutionary spirit. Every single time I had shown this clip in the
past, three sentences in particular had without fail provoked
laughter. Would CSIS employees lol at the lulz? In the video,
as clouds move quickly over a large, indistinct, glass corporate
building, a dramatic voice intones:
Anonymous has therefore decided that your organization
should be destroyed. For the good of your followers, for
the good of mankind and for our own enjoyment. We shall
proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically
dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form.
The room erupted in laughter. Mission accomplished; there
was no better proof of the infectious spirit of the lulz than this
moment. Intelligence agents were laughing at the lulzy video
made by Anonymous trolls that gave birth to the “threat” they
were tasked with assessing. I will get out of here alive after all,
I silently sighed.
After my lecture, a smaller group of us relocated to a
cramped and dingy conference room with no windows to eat
bland sandwiches and cookies under the glare of fluorescent
lights. I secretly wondered if there was a nicer conference room 
with skylights reserved for the political scientists or economists and other more highly esteemed guests. We sat down in
the office chairs and went around the room introducing ourselves. I was still too out of sorts to remember particular roles
or titles, much less names. I was certainly not taking notes or
secretly recording the conversation. I suspect they were. For
all I knew, I could be talking to janitors, or to employees with
the highest level of security clearance. One title did stick out,
though—that of the other anthropologist in the room. When
introduced, he nodded and smiled at me. I, meanwhile, tried
hard to keep my poker face intact. All sorts of questions sprung
to mind: Is he actually trained as an anthropologist? Where
did he go to school? Who was his PhD advisor? When and
why did he decide to work for the CSIS? Do they pay better
than academia? But I kept my queries to myself. I was worried
he would misconstrue my curiosity as interest in working for
CSIS, and I wanted to avoid any recruitment overtures.
During the course of what at first felt like a meandering
conversation, it eventually became apparent why I had been
invited. They wanted to know one thing: whether I thought
Anonymous had set their sights on taking down the power
grid. The timing was not accidental. Just a month earlier, the
NSA had stated that Anonymous was an imminent threat to
national security, and I suppose Canada was feeling a bit of
international pressure to monitor the shadowy group.
I answered honestly. For all its legal and illegal tactics to
date, I explained, Anonymous had never publicly called for
such an attack. There was no evidence at the time to suggest
that the group would so much as consider doing such a thing.
I did not feel like I was divulging anything secret, as I had
commented to the press about this very subject. In fact, I felt
like I was doing Anonymous a favor.
Of course, as a busy professor I could not spend all of my
time on the many channels of the various IRC networks, much
less monitor every single chat room where such a conversation could take place. There were also private conversations
Introduction 13
14 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
and invite-only channels I never actually entered. “Their sociology is labyrinthine,” I explained with deliberation, likely
exhibiting my own frustrations with navigating and researching Anonymous. I had probably spent more hours staring at
my computer and chatting with Anonymous participants than
any non-Anon, with the possible exception of informants,
who were forced to be online nearly full-time. I explained that
I had never seen even a hint of such a plan. Indeed, every
radical action, even the doxing of belligerent police officers,
provoked contentious debate about its moral appropriateness.
“While Anonymous is often duplicitous and devilishly confusing,” I explained, “Anons are certainly not seeking to kill
anyone. They organize at home, possibly in their underwear,
typing away madly at the computer. The only ‘violence’ some
participants engage in is likely of the virtual type, during their
World of Warcraft video game battles that some percentage of
them surely must play.” To hammer my point home, I offered
a bit of humor, paraphrasing one Anon who had cracked the
following joke soon after the NSA claimed that Anonymous
was indeed capable of targeting the grid: “That’s right, we’re
definitely taking down the power grid. We’ll know we’ve succeeded when all the equipment we use to mount our campaign
is rendered completely useless.”
Postures loosened. Laughter again reverberated among the
G-men (and women—this was 2012 after all). And as far as I
could tell, everyone seemed genuinely relieved by my assessment. They could go back to focusing on more pressing matters.
The joke opened the door to further conversation concerning the media’s central role in amplifying the power of
Anonymous. One CSIS agent shared his anger at the media
for making this collective of collectives more powerful than
they ought to have been. I was, I have to admit, relishing the
fact that the G-men and Anons, mutually opposed at one level,
were nevertheless (very loosely) allied in holding an ambivalent attitude toward the mass media. We all agreed that the
media had helped to make Anonymous what it was today. 
Then the resident CSIS anthropologist, whose specialty
was Middle East terrorism, made an offhand comment that
shocked even me: jihadists, he explained, were impressed by
the level of media attention Anonymous attained. Did I hear
that correctly, I wondered? I just could not fathom Al Qaeda
operatives watching Anonymous videos, much less grasping
the nature of their culture or politics, and especially not the
lulz. I imagined that jihadists would be rather repelled by
Anonymous’s secular, infidel, offensive practices. Laughing
heartily together, we all agreed that those jihadist terrorists
likely did not celebrate the lulz (or were utterly devoid of
them). The conversation reminded me of something one Anon
had told me during an informal online chat:
<A>: yeah, it‘s that idea of humor and irreverence which is at the
heart of this [Anonymous]
<A>: it‘s what will stop it ever being able to be labeled terrorist
Despite the laughter, I still felt rather uncomfortable and
hyper-aware of my mask of scholarly detachment. Appearing
cool and composed on the outside, on the inside I was thinking to myself, I can’t believe I am joking about jihadists,
Anonymous, and the lulz with CSIS! I wanted nothing more
than to leave—which I finally did at the conclusion of lunch.
I was relieved to return to my hotel. I tried to push away the
creeping thought that my room at the Lord Elgin Hotel in
downtown Ottawa, booked by CSIS, was bugged.
Even today, I am not sure how I feel about my decision to
visit CSIS; in those situations, one can divulge, quite unwillingly, important information, even when officials are not
expressly seeking or asking for anything particular. Maybe
there is something unethical, too, about disclosing how
important the media is in amplifying Anonymous’s power—a
bit like drawing open a curtain to reveal that the Wizard is
a little old man pulling at the levers of a machine. On the
other hand, the media’s power is an open secret within
Introduction 15
16 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Anonymous, a topic routinely discussed by the activists
themselves.
In hindsight, and for better or worse, I believe some element
of the trickster spirit nudged me to accept CSIS’s invitation. Tricksters, like the Norse god Loki, have poor impulse
control. They are driven by lust or curiosity. Intrigue propelled
me to visit CSIS, despite my anxiety and reservations. I had a
burning question that I needed answered: would they laugh at
the lulz? So I guess, like trolls, “I did it for the lulz.” Thanks
to my glimpse inside Canada’s spy agency, I got my answer:
the lulz can be (nearly) universally appreciated. But I learned
even more than that, thanks to the other anthropologist in the
room. That final joke about the jihadists and the lulz taught
me another lesson about Anonymous, which is important to
convey as we start this adventure.
No single group or individual can claim legal ownership
of the name “Anonymous,” much less its icons and imagery.
Naturally, this has helped Anonymous spread across the
globe. It has now become the quintessential anti-brand brand,
assuming various configurations and meanings, even as it
has also become the popular face of unrest around the globe.
Even if the name “Anonymous” is free to take—as Topiary,
an Anonymous activist, put it before he was arrested, “You
cannot arrest an idea”—the jihadist example is a powerful
reminder that its radical openness does not mean everyone can
or even wants to embrace the name or its attendant imagery.
Culture has a funny way of asserting itself, even among a
group of activists who seek to defy boundaries and who have
erected one of the most accessible, resilient, and open domains
of activism today.
Indeed, by the time I visited CSIS in 2012, Anonymous had
become multitudinous, prolific, and unpredictable. Of course,
since the collective is a by-product of the Internet, it is unsurprising that Anonymous rises up most forcefully and shores
up most support when defending values associated with this
global communication platform, like free speech. As one 
participant once put it, “Free speech is non-negotiable.” But
what they have demonstrated time and again is they are not
restricted to a concern with civil liberties. Over the last five
years, activists have contributed to an astonishing array of
causes, from publicizing rape cases (as they did in Halifax,
Canada, and Steubenville, Ohio) to assisting in the Arab and
African Spring of 2011.
Various factors conspire to secure the group’s flexibility.
There are no agreed-upon mandates to uphold. Participants
associated with Anonymous steadfastly resist institutionalization. Its reputation is difficult to sully. You don’t even need to be
a hacker (no, really) to participate in Anonymous operations.
The group’s bold, Hollywood-style aesthetics strike a familiar
chord in the society of the spectacle. And when Anonymous
reacts to world events, it engages in a broad range of activities, with leaking and exposing security vulnerabilities acting
as two of its signal interventions.
All these elements—which also come together in different
proportions and configurations—make it almost impossible
to know when or why Anonymous will strike, when a new
node will appear, whether a campaign will be successful,
and how the group might change direction or tactics during
the course of an operation. Its unpredictability may be what
makes Anonymous so frightening to governments and corporations across the world.
Although devilishly hard to study, Anonymous is neither
wholly random nor simply chaotic. To be Anonymous means
to follow a series of related principles. Anonymous follows a
spirit of humorous deviance, works though diverse technical
bodies (such as IRC), is built on an anti-celebrity ethic, and
intervenes politically in astoundingly rich and varied ways.
This book will seek to unravel some of the complexities and
paradoxes inherent to a politically engaged Anonymous—
but before we turn to its activist interventions, let’s take a
close look at the grisly underworld of trolling from which
Anonymous hatched.
Introduction 17
chapter 1
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz
Prior to 2008, when Anonymous unexpectedly sprouted
an activist sensibility, the brand had been used exclusively
for what, in Internet parlance, is known as “trolling”: the
targeting of people and organizations, the desecration of reputations, and the spreading of humiliating information. Despite
the fame Anonymous accrued in its mass trolling campaigns,
it was certainly not the only player in the game; the trolling
pantheon was then, and remains today, both large and diverse.
Trolling is a multifarious activity that flourishes online and
boasts a range of tight-knit associations (such as the Patriotic
Nigras, Bantown, Team Roomba, Rustle League), a variety of
genres (differentiated mostly by target—for example, griefers target gamers, RIP trolls target the families and friends of
the recently deceased), and a small pantheon of famed individuals (Violentacrez, Jameth). Its originary point extends far
before the alpha of the Internet, taking root in the vagaries
of myth and oral culture. Despite this diversity, contemporary Internet trolls are united in an almost universal claiming
of lulz as the causal force and desired effect of their endeavors. Our story can begin with one of the most notorious
pursuants.
One day, completely out of the blue, I received a phone
call from one of the most famous trolls of all time: Andrew 
20 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Auernheimer, known to most simply as “weev.” He reached out
to me on August 28, 2010, in a sixty-second phone message:
Yes, Ms. Coleman. This is weev. That is W-E-E-V and you
might be familiar with my work. I see that you are giving a
presentation on hackers, trolls, and the politics of spectacle.
And I just want say that I am the master of the spectacle.
This is my art, ma’am. And also you have given some sort of
presentation on the lulz and I was in the room when the lulz
was first said. So I want to make sure that you’re interpreting and representing my culture, and my people, correctly.
I don’t want some charlatan that is telling lies about my
history and my culture. So I would like to talk with you
some and understand what you are doing to make sure that
you not just another bullshit academic. So hit me up, my
email is gluttony@XXX.com. That is G-L-U-T-T-O-N-Y
at XXX dot com. I expect a response, Ms. Coleman. It is
extremely important.
After listening, I was so startled I actually dropped the phone.
I was overcome with excitement. But also fear. I picked the
phone up, rapidly punched in a seemingly endless stream of
numbers, listened to the message three more times, recorded
it, and promptly went home, only to spend the rest of the
evening brooding. I wished he had never called.
weev’s reputation obviously preceded him; despite my rudimentary research on trolls and my ongoing research on the
activism of Anonymous, I had avoided him like the bubonic
plague. Although trolling is often experienced and disguised
as play, it is also shrouded in mystery, danger, and recklessness. weev is a past president of one of the most exclusive
trolling cliques still in existence today, the offensively named
Gay Nigger Association of America (GNAA). (Affiliates
quiz prospective members on trivia about an obscure porn
film called Gayniggers from Outer Space, which inspired the
group’s name.) Reaching out to such a revolting troll might 
spell trouble. Trolls are notorious for waging so-called “ruin
life” campaigns, in which they spread humiliating stories
(regardless of truthfulness) about a chosen target, and leak
vital information like addresses and Social Security numbers.
The effect is akin to being cursed, branded, and stigmatized
all at once. The psychological effects can be terrifyingly long
lasting.1
But since I also ran a risk by ignoring his request—he did,
after all, flag it as extremely important—I sent him an email a
few days later. And, since I had already taken the plunge, I also
figured it might make sense to acquaint myself with another
genre of trolling. In contrast to weev’s boastful, elitist, selfaggrandizing style, Anonymous had historically demonstrated
a far more self-effacing and populist mode of trolling. Like
two sides of a coin, both belonged to the same “tribe” while
also countering one another. For about two minutes I even
entertained, with faint excitement, the prospect of detailing a
troll typology. Just as my anthropological ancestors once categorized tribes, skulls, and axes, perhaps I could do the same
with trolls and their horrible exploits, trollishly playing, all the
while, with my discipline’s historical penchant for irrelevant
and sometimes racist categorization. Quickly the excitement
faded as I contemplated the ruinous reality this could bring
down upon me if I got on the wrong side of these notorious
trolls; I remembered that I had already decided to focus on the
activism of Anonymous and not its trolling heyday for a very
good reason. In the end, I hoped weev would ignore the email
from me sitting in his inbox.
But, when he emailed me back, I realized there was nothing
to do but commit. We finally connected via Skype chat. His
handle was “dirk diggler,” after the porn star protagonist of
the 1997 film Boogie Nights. Later, when we switched to IRC,
he used “weev”:
<dirk diggler>: how are you?
<biella>: good and you?
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 21
22 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<dirk diggler>: coming down off of some vile substance
<biella>: you are up early
<dirk diggler>: methylenedioxypyrovalorone i think it was called
<dirk diggler>: its late, technically
<dirk diggler>: as i havent slept
<biella>: i woke up at 3 am but that is not all that usual for me
<dirk diggler>: i am working on my latest shitstorm right now
<dirk diggler>: disruptive technological developments are gr8
<biella>: you are pretty adept at that as well
<dirk diggler>: yes i am switching from the mdpv to the coffee
<dirk diggler>: i am hoping this will smooth the downward spiral long
enough for me to ship this motherfucker live today
<biella>: no chance you will be in nyc in the near future, is there?
<dirk diggler>: probably not
<dirk diggler>: its a vile city
<biella>: haha, really?
<dirk diggler>: disgusting place
<biella>: how come?
<dirk diggler>: the only decent people in NYC are the black israelites
<dirk diggler>: nyc is a city founded on the repulsive order of the
financiers
His denunciation of “the repulsive order of the financiers” had
the ring of truth, given the recent financial mess their recklessness had engendered, so I found myself, only minutes into
my first bona fide conversation with a world famous troll, in
agreement with him:
<biella>: that is true
<dirk diggler>: it is a sinful and decadent place
<biella>: there are less and less spaces for the non-rich
<dirk diggler>: and wherever immoral people are in control, i find that
everyone tries to emulate them
<biella>: Detroit is like the only city were there is possibility imho (big
city)
<dirk diggler>: nah slab city has the best potential in all of the USA
<dirk diggler>: part of god’s war is going on right there right now
<biella>: never been
It is true: I had not spent time in Slab City. It was, in fact, the
first time I had even heard about it. And so, as we chatted,
I was also googling “Slab City,” which actually exists and
is a fascinating Wild West campground/squatter haven in
Colorado. I soon came to learn that even if weev often lies, he
also often speaks the truth, and his knowledge of the strange,
fantastical, and shocking is encyclopedic—he is a natural
ethnographer of the most extreme and vile forms of human
esoterica.
By dedicating much of his teenage and early adult years to
hacking and trolling—and the consumption of large quantities of drugs, if he is to be believed—weev had amassed a vast
catalog of technical and human exploits. His most famous
coup, which won him a three-and-a-half-year jail sentence,
was directed at AT&T, a beloved target among hackers
because of its cozy information-sharing practices with the US
government. (AT&T’s well-known activities in room 641A, a
telecommunication interception facility operated by the NSA,
now seem quaint given the news that most major telecommunications providers and Internet companies provide the
US government generous access to customer data.) weev targeted AT&T with Goatse Security, the name given to GNAA’s
impromptu security group. They discovered in June 2010
that the giant American telco had done something stupid and
irresponsible: AT&T’s iPad customer data was posted on the
Internet unprotected. Typically, a company with good security practices will encrypt things like customer names, email
addresses, and the unique ID numbers associated with these
iPads. But AT&T had not, at least in this instance, encrypt
anything.
While they didn’t exactly leave the customer data sitting
on a doorstep with a sign saying “Come and Get It,” the data
was still unusually easy to access. Indeed, Goatse Security
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 23
24 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
figured out an easy way to “slurp” the data using a script (a
short, easy-to-use computer program), which was written by
GNAA/Goatse member Daniel Spitler, aka “JacksonBrown.”
The gray hat security crew called it, with uncanny precision,
the “iPad 3G Account Slurper” and used it to harvest the data
of 140,000 subscribers. The opportunity to expose shoddy
security of this magnitude is irresistible to any hacker—even
one like weev who, as he told me over dinner when we finally
met in person, is not even that talented of a technologist (or,
perhaps more likely, he is just too lazy to do the grunt work
since he certainly grasps many of the finer technical points
pertaining to security).
Whatever the case, Spitler wrote the script itself and has
since pleaded guilty in court. And yet weev was also convicted
in November 2012 for “hacking” AT&T’s system: a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). But the
fact remains: since there was no security to speak of, there
was nothing, technically, to “hack.” Daniel Spitler’s script did
not compromise an otherwise secure system, and weev—who
contributed minor improvements to the script—mostly acted
as the publicist. He offered the vulnerability to news outlets
for free. He was interested in exposing AT&T’s shocking
lack of security in the public interest and boosting his public
profile. The CFAA, it must be said, is a decidedly blunt legal
instrument—so broad that it affords prosecutors tremendous
power in any legal proceeding that relates, in virtually any
way, to the vague notion of “unauthorized computer access.”
The activities need not be hacking at all. Some courts have
interpreted “unauthorized access” to mean computer use that
simply violates the terms of service or other rules posed by the
computer’s owner.2
After his CFAA conviction, weev’s case attracted a trio
of topnotch lawyers: Orin Kerr, Marcia Hofmann, and Tor
Ekeland. They appealed his case, seeking to overturn what
they, along with many security professionals, deemed a dangerous precedent capable of chilling vital future security 
research; the security industry relies on hackers and researchers discovering vulnerabilities, using the same methods as
criminal hackers, in order to expose weakness and strengthen
infrastructure for both private and public good. Finally, in
April 2014—and only after he had served roughly twelve
months of a forty-one-month sentence—his case was vacated.
But not due to the the CFAA portion of the appeal—instead
due to the question of venue. The court determined that New
Jersey, where the original case was tried, was not the state
where the offense was committed. Tor Ekeland explained the
importance of this legal ruling to the Guardian: “If the court
had ruled the other way, you would have had universal venue
in … computer fraud and abuse cases, and that would have
had huge implications for the Internet and computer law.”3
Still, although weev’s supporters were thrilled that he was now
free and pleased that questions of venue had been clarified,
many were disappointed that the proceedings left the broader
CFAA issue untouched—the dangerous precedent remained.
By taking this information to the media, weev demonstrated
an intent beyond mere trolling. Any self-respecting hacker will
cry foul in the face of terrible security; taking it to the press—
which will generate a huge fuss about it—can be a responsible
thing to do. Of course, to hear weev tell the story, it was clear
that he also did it for the lulz. He would giggle whenever Goatse
Security was mentioned in news reports about the incident.
He imagined millions of people Googling the strange name of
the security group, and then recoiling in horror at the sight of
a vile “anal supernova” beaming off their screen.4
 Goatse is a
notoriously grotesque Internet image of a man hunched over
and pulling apart his butt cheeks wider than you might think
is humanly possible. Those who view it are forever unable
to unsee what they have just seen—unable to forget even
the smallest detail, their minds seared by the image as if the
gaping maw, adorned with a ring, were a red-hot cattle brand.
The immaturity of the joke would escalate weev’s giggles into
tears, which spilled out the sides of his pinched eyes; he would
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 25
26 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
hunch over, holding his stomach as his shoulders shook, his
laugh like a demonic jackhammer.
Clearly, weev offended everyone, including law enforcement.
The ultimate testament to his incendiary nature is, perhaps, the
judge’s rather stiff sentence. After all, he was not even party to
writing the script. The night before his sentencing, he wrote on
reddit, a popular nerd website, that “My regret is being nice
enough to give AT&T a chance to patch before dropping the
dataset to Gawker. I won’t nearly be as nice next time.”5
 To
justify the sentence, the prosecution cited his reddit comments
not once, not twice, but three times.
For weev, such incendiary behavior is par for the course.
He has recorded hateful speeches railing against Jews and
African Americans—“sermons,” as he calls them—which can
be viewed on YouTube. They are so hateful that they even
disgust other trolls.
We started chatting soon after his legal troubles relating to
AT&T began. During the next five months we chatted often.
There were some moments that can only be described as
strange. Take, for instance, a conversation that occurred on
December 12, 2010:
<weev>: hello there
<weev>: how are you
<biella>: pretty good and you?
<weev>: cant complain
<weev>: GNAA has switched forms of governance
<weev>: it is now an Athenian democracy
<weev>: where those who have completed their military service
<weev>: i.e. done any cool trolling
<weev>: are now eligible to vote on measures
I was, I recall vividly, incredulous. But I still managed, barely,
to type a response:
<biella>: really?
Then out of the blue, as is often the case with internet chatting
—especially with weev—he hopped to another topic while I
was in the midst of responding to questions of governance:
<weev>: my bondsman called me randomly
<biella>: what was it before? [before becoming an Athenian democracy]
<weev>: yes
<weev>: i suspect i may be arrested tomorrow or on the 16th
<weev>: i am having to divide up responsibilities
<weev>: because nobody can do all the shit i did
<biella>: 4 real?
[…]
<biella>: i mean why do you think you are being arrested?
<weev>: my bondsman called me randomly
<weev>: to verify my current location
<weev>: last time that happened
<weev>: the door got kicked in the next day
At the time he was under investigation. I know he was a troll
and all but, let’s face it: jail sucks. I told him I would visit and
expressed my sympathies:
<weev>: thank you
<weev>: i will enjoy the company
<biella>: and gluten free treats that i will bring
<weev>: :D
<weev>: i just discovered
<weev>: how to make a passable gluten free bread
<weev>: u gotta just use a variety of shit
<weev>: brown rice, tapioca and taff flours
<weev>: and potato starch
It was natural, then, that weev, a gluten-free troll chatting
with a gluten-free anthropologist, would seamlessly transition into a discussion of Pilates. Regrettably, I never did get
a proper answer on the subject of troll governance. Many
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 27
28 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
conversations followed this unpredictable, always entertaining, arc.
I was earnest with him for the most part, but I played along
with his self-styled hoaxer role. At the same time, I couldn’t
resist calling him out on his bullshit sometimes, even trolling
him just a little:
<weev>: i have a very broad range of knowledge for a highschool
dropout
<biella>: except you studied anthro at James Madison :-)
<weev>: yes well
<biella>: but you do have a broad range of knowledge
<weev>: i am just a poor country boy from arkansas
<weev>: i dropped out of college because it was too much for my
simple southern mind
<weev>: plus i was disgusted at the degeneracy of american institutions
<weev>: all the social sciences have become an elaborate scheme
for giving white kids racial inferiority complexes, or destroying the
gender roles that make our society work
As a social science professor, I had some insider knowledge of
this “elaborate scheme.” I could not help but feed him some
of my own lies:
<biella>: omg totally
<weev>: or otherwise promoting judeo-bolshevist/marxist idologues
<biella>: they secretly train us to do that (it is quite intensive)
<weev>: i dont know if ur being sarcastic or sincere
<weev>: is the hilarious part
<biella>: lol
<biella>: welcome to biella’s world of chatting with weev as well :-)
He did in fact serve jail time in various states, ending up in
New Jersey where he was released on bail February 28, 2011,
to await trial. Since he was no longer allowed online, our chats
came to an end. Instead, we continued to converse in person, 
over gluten-free food, in NYC. I footed the bill since he was
really, really broke. Although he did teach me a fair bit about
trolling, he never used his skills on me.
Although weev’s bail conditions banned him from using
a computer, he still managed to practice his craft. weev, like
many trolls, likes to dupe people in order to draw attention
to himself. Putting oneself in the limelight feels great, especially if you don’t need to pay a PR person to post a fake
sex tape. In May 2011, as summer finally descended on
NYC, he excitedly texted me. “Google my name,” he wrote.
I did as commanded, and hundreds of news articles popped
up on my browser. He had duped the media with an inperson hoax, claiming to be Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s neighbor immediately after rape charges were leveled against the
wealthy French politician and former head of the International
Monetary Fund. weev, then utterly destitute, managed to slip
his comments into hundreds of newspapers; no journalist
bothered to fact-check him:
Despite the prosecutor’s claims, however, Strauss-Kahn
is already meeting his neighbors. An infamous computer
hacker who lives in the corporate apartment building on
Broadway claims he has already met the Frenchman—and
he is ‘an OK guy’.
‘We’re all like one big Breakfast Club in there,’ Andrew
Auernheimer, 26, was reported as saying in reference to the
1985 classic film about five high school students trapped in
Saturday detention.6
In Lulz We Trust
So if weev, like so many trolls, dishes out his actions on mixed
platters of truth and lies, is it possible to determine whether he
was actually in the room when the “lulz” first whooshed off
the tip of a tongue? To probe this question further, let’s turn
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 29
30 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
to Encyclopedia Dramatica (ED), a stunningly detailed online
compendium cataloging troll mechanics, history, gore, and
lore. Despite bearing the title “Encyclopedia,” it strives neither
for neutrality nor objectivity. ED is, indeed, encyclopedic in
its detail—but it is also outrageous in tone and riddled with
lies. What ED does well (and in this way it actually achieves a
strange measure of objectivity) is display the moral kinetics of
trolling. Is ED’s etymologizing of the lulz, a snippet of which
is provided below, fact or fable?:
█▄ █▄█ █▄ ▀█▄ is a corruption of L O L, which stands
for “Laugh Out Loud,” signifying laughter at someone else’s
expense. This makes it inherently superior to lesser forms
of humor. Anonymous gets big lulz from pulling random
pranks. The pranks are always posted on the internet. Just
as the element of surprise transforms the physical act of
love into something beautiful, the anguish of a laughed-at
victim transforms lol into lulz, making it longer, girthier, and
more pleasurable. Lulz is engaged in by Internet users who
have witnessed one major economic/environmental/political
disaster too many, and who thus view a state of voluntary,
gleeful sociopathy over the world’s current apocalyptic
state, as superior to being continually emo.
The term “lulz” was first coined by Jameth, an original
Encyclopedia Dramatica administrator, and the term became
very popular on that website. The nickname originated
sometime in early 2001 when James (his real name, the -th
suffix being a pun on his faggotry and his small p3n0r) was
having a conversation with a lisping homosexual. James was
being referred to as Jameth because of the person’s speech
impediment. In June 2001, James decided to use Jameth as
his LiveJournal account name. Don’t let him fool you—
James craves the cock.7
According to information from multiple interviews, including
one with ED’s sharp and witty founder, Sherrod DeGrippo, 
weev did, indeed, participate in the conference call when
Jameth coined the term; and Jameth is, in fact, gay. I never
inquired about his lisp.8
Today, the lulz can encompass lighthearted jokes as well,
and are utilized and enjoyed by many Internet nerds around
the world. But, at its inception, its demeanor was conceived as
cruel—“laughter at the expense or the misfortune of others,” is
how trolls like to define it. Lulz is a quintessential example of
what folklorists define as argot—specialized and esoteric terminology used by a subcultural group. Since argot is so opaque
and particular, it functions to enact secrecy or, at minimum,
erect some very stiff social boundaries. As an anthropologist,
it is tempting, no matter how ridiculous it seems, to view lulz
in terms of epistemology—through the social production of
knowledge. At one level, the lulz functions as an epistemic
object, stabilizing a set of experiences by making them available for reflection. For decades, there was no term for the lulz,
but trolls and hackers nevertheless experienced the distinctive
pleasures of pranking. Once a name like “lulz” comes into
being, it opens the very practice it names to further reflection
by its practitioners. Trolls now pontificate over the meaning
of the lulz, employing the term to designate particularly satisfying acts (whether or not they are intentionally done for the
lulz) and also to diagnose situations lacking in lulz—which, of
course, demands reparatory courses of action.
Just what does the term do or signify which no other word
can? This is harder to convey. But if we keep in mind that lulz
derives from the acronym “lol” (laugh out loud), it becomes
easier to see that lulz is primarily about humor. Lols are familiar to everyone who has ever sent a joke to someone by email.
Lulz are darker: acquired most often at someone’s expense,
prone to misfiring and, occasionally, bordering on disturbing or hateful speech (except, of course, when they cross the
border entirely: thank you rape jokes). Lulz are unmistakably
imbued with danger and mystery, and thus speak foremost to
the pleasures of transgression.

We can see the defining features of lulz in weev’s AT&T
affair—not in his exposure of the security hole, but in the way
he got respectable newscasters all over the United States to
utter the word “Goatse,” unwittingly referencing one of the
most disgusting images on the Internet. In practice, lulzy activity defies boundaries but also re-erects them. There is a divide
between people who are merely LOLing on the Internet—
without really knowing what the Internet is or where it
came from or how it works on the inside—and those who
are lulzing (i.e., hackers, trolls, etc.) and know exactly what
the underbelly is about. The lulz are both a form of cultural
differentiation and a tool or weapon used to attack, humiliate, and defame the unwitting normal LOLers—often without
them even realizing that an entire culture is aligned against
them. Usually, the lulz are inside jokes, but (often) they are
equal opportunity: lulz may provoke laughter not just among
trolls, but outsiders as well. The price of admission is just a
bit of knowledge. LOLers can be drawn into the world of
lulz thanks to websites populated by trolls like Encyclopedia
Dramatica, 4chan, and Something Awful, which disseminate
this knowledge to anyone who cares to look for it. Those who
find it may choose to run away very quickly, or they might
become the next generation of trolls.
The lulz show how easily and casually trolls can upend our
sense of security by invading private spaces and exposing confidential information. Targets receive scores of unpaid pizzas at
home or have their unlisted phone numbers published, Social
Security numbers leaked, private communications posted,
credit card numbers doxed, and hard drive contents seeded.
Trolls enjoy desecrating anything remotely sacred, as cultural
theorist Whitney Phillips conveys in her astute characterization of trolls as “agents of cultural digestion [who] scavenge
the landscape, re-purpose the most offensive material, then
shove the resulting monstrosities into the faces of an unsuspecting populace.”9
 In short: any information thought to be
personal, secure, or sacred is a prime target for sharing or 
defilement in a multitude of ways. Lulz-oriented actions puncture the consensus around our politics and ethics, our social
lives, and our aesthetic sensibilities. Any presumption of our
world’s inviolability becomes a weapon; trolls invalidate that
world by gesturing toward the possibility for Internet geeks
to destroy it—to pull the carpet from under us whenever they
feel the urge.
I came to trolls just as a subset of them was experiencing a
crucial transformation: increasingly, people working under the
aegis of Anonymous began pursuing activism. Given the seedy
underbelly I have just described, the development was beyond
surprising. However, it was not without historical precedent:
I recognized trolls as kin to the tricksters of myth. After all, I
am an anthropologist, and tricksters are a time-honored topic
of anthropological rumination.
To Trick or to Treat?
The trickster archetype comes replete with a diverse number
of icons and often-delightful tales. Greek and Roman mythology brought some of these figures into the heart of Western
culture: the mercurial Hermes and the bacchanalian Dionysus,
among others. In West African and Caribbean folklores the role
falls to Anansi, a spider who sometimes imparts knowledge
or wisdom—and sometimes casts doubt or seeds confusion.
Eshu, the god of communication and crossroads, is similarly
ambiguous. Known for orchestrating chaotic scenarios that
force human decisions, he can be a kind teacher or an agent
of destruction. Among indigenous North Americans, Raven
initiates change by will or by accident, and Coyote is a selfish
beast who will trick any being—human or animal—to satisfy
his appetites. The Western conception of the trickster has,
since the medieval period, often been delivered in literature.

Dream, was not an invention of Shakespeare’s, but has roots
in a mischievous fairy of Celtic folklore. The shapeshifter Loki
of Nordic mythology has recently reappeared in Hollywood
films, mostly as a bland version of his mythological self, and
still serves as a reminder of the capricious, vindictive role the
trickster can perform.
Tricksters are united by a few characteristics, such as the
burning desire to defy or defile rules, norms, and laws. Often
lacking both impulse control and the ability to experience
shame, they are outrageous and unfiltered in their speech.
Some tricksters are driven by a higher calling, like Loki, who
sometimes works for the gods (though true to his fearsome
nature, he sometimes causes problems for them). Many are
propelled by curiosity and voracious appetite. They rarely
plan their actions, choosing instead an unbridled spontaneity
that translates into a wily unpredictability. While capriciousness often underwrites successful trickster exploits, it can also
trip trolls up.10
Trickster tales are not didactic and moralizing but reveal
their lessons playfully. They can function normatively—
when parents offer scary stories to dissuade kids from
misbehaving—or critically, allowing norms to be laid bare for
folk-philosophical challenge. Lewis Hyde, who has written
extensively on the trickster motif, notes that “the origins, liveliness, and durability of cultures require that there be a space
for figures whose function is to uncover and disrupt the very
things that cultures are based on.”11
It is not difficult to imagine the troll and Anonymous as
contemporary trickster figures. They are provocateurs and
saboteurs who dismantle convention while occupying a liminal
zone. They are well positioned to impart lessons—regardless
of their intent. Their actions need not be accepted, much less
endorsed, to extract positive value. We may see them as edifying us with liberating or terrifying perspectives, symptomatic
of underlying problems that deserve scrutiny, functioning as a
positive force toward renewal, or as distorting and confusing 
shadows. The trickster becomes one heuristic—certainly not
the only or primary one—for understanding the sources,
the myriad effects, and especially, the Janus face of morally
slippery entities like trolls and Anonymous.
Before we get to Anonymous proper, it is worth taking a
brief (incomplete) tour through the vibrant tradition of trolling/tricksterdom on the Internet. The nature of the Internet—a
network built on software—makes it ideal for both play and
exploitation;12 it is like a petri dish for pranking. Indeed,
hackers (and later trolls) have been at this sort of behavior for
a long time. But it is only recently that some of these activities
have attained a more visible, publicly available mythological
status. For example, gathered in the Encyclopedia Dramatica
are copious links to cases of historical techno-tricksterism. By
exploring these lineages we can better understand what makes
Anonymous—both the trolls and activists—distinctive among
a broader pantheon of technological tricksters.
A (Brief) Natural History of Internet Tricksterdom
(Or, a Genealogy of a Lack of Morals)
weev is a troll’s troll—a rare standout in a field that mostly
spawns so many garden varieties.
Troll ancestry boasts a rather eclectic and varied cast of characters. Trolling was common in the hacker underground—a
place for subversive hackers who thrived in the 1980s and
1990s, seeking out forbidden knowledge by rummaging
around, uninvited, in other people’s computers. But even they
have to thank their direct ancestors, the phone phreaks, for
the aesthetics of audacity. Fusing technological spelunking
with mischief, phone phreaks illegally entered the telephone
system by re-creating the audio frequencies used by the system
to route calls. They did it to learn and explore, to be sure. But
the thrill of transgression was equally integral to the joy of
phreaking. In the 1960s and 1970s, phreaks would use their
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 35
36 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
skills to congregate on telephone conference “party lines.”
Phreaking attracted some blind kids, who found a source of
freedom in connecting with others on the phone. Over the telephone wires, from near and far, people who couldn’t see each
other would meet to chat, gossip, share technological tidbits,
and plan and execute pranks. Lots of pranks. Naturally, most
of these pranks involved phone calls. While most of them were
lighthearted, a few exhibited a fearsome bite. Phil Lapsley, a
historian of phreaks, recounts an infamous 1974 hoax where
phreaks exploited a rare bug in the phone system to reroute
all calls made to residents of Santa Barbara, California, to a
phony emergency worker who would warn: “There has been
a nuclear explosion in Santa Barbara and all the telephone
lines are out.”13 weev, no stranger to history, adores phone
pranks and sees himself as an inheritor of this illustrious
lineage.
The end of the analog phone network, after the divestiture of “Ma Bell” (the affectionate name given to AT&T by
phreaks), spelled the end of the golden age of phreaking. It
was largely replaced by the exploration of computer networks, giving rise to the hacker underground, which peaked
in the 1990s. Although many of these underground hackers
acquired, circulated, and produced technical knowledge—
scouting for security vulnerabilities and edifying technical
curiosities—they were also connoisseurs of forbidden fruit.
Thus, it is no wonder that their actions expanded from strictly
technical engagements and into ones that included mockery,
spectacle, and transgression. They quickly distinguished
their politics and ethics from the university hackers of MIT,
Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford; these hackers, who in the
1960s stayed up all night to access their beloved computers
otherwise tied up for official use during the day, have been
chronicled majestically by journalist Steven Levy.14 Though
these early hackers also had an affinity for pranking, they
abided by a more robust ethos of transparency and access than
underground hackers.
Many underground hackers were puckish in their pranking
and hacking pursuits. They were mischief-makers and merry
wanderers of the network. There was, however, a cohort
of underground hackers who more closely resembled the
Loki archetype in their network jaunts and haunts. When I
interview hackers who were active in the 1990s about their
trolling activities, the conversation inevitably turns toward a
discussion of the most feared hacker/troll of the era: “u4ea”
(pronounced “euphoria” and eerily similar to “lulz” in its figuration). So terrifying was this troll’s reign that every time I
utter u4ea to one of his contemporaries, their demeanor blackens and proceedings assume an unmatched seriousness. u4ea
is Canadian. More notoriously, this troll was “founder, president, and dictator for life” of hacker group BRoTHeRHooD
oF WaReZ—(“BoW” for short; Warez is pirated software—
“BoW” sought to poke fun at Bulletin Board System warez
groups). According to a former member whom I chatted with
online, the “paramilitary wing” of BoW, called “Hagis” (short
for “Hackers against Geeks in Snowsuits”), went on cruel
hacking and pranking campaigns against targets ranging from
corporations, law-abiding white hat hackers, and infosecurity
gurus, to basically anyone else who got in their line of fire. To
take one example, in the late 1990s Hagis went ballistic during
a multi-year feud with a white hat hacker named Jay Dyson.
First they went after his Internet service provider, deleting all
their files and knocking them offline for two weeks. Later, they
deleted files on Dyson’s business website. For good measure,
they harassed his wife with threatening messages, informing
her, via her hacked email account, that “All the Dyson family
will pay for the mistakes of Big Jay.”15
Upon learning about this and other attacks from the former
BoW member I chatted with, I wrote:
<biella>: man, ruthless
<hacker>: yeah, we were a fairly vicious bunch to the point that i

<hacker>: we were a genuine subculture, our own news, our own
celebrities, our own slang, our own culture
And I could not help but add:
<biella>: and your own wars
Still, Hagis could also be quite jocular. Once, they defaced the
Greenpeace website and posted what today might be considered a classically lulzy message meant to publicize the ordeal
of an arrested phone phreak and hacker named Kevin Mitnick:
“Phree Kevin Mitnick or we will club 600 baby seals.”16
After going this deep (which is to say, barely scratching
the surface), I decided that my interlocutors were right: it
was time to ease off on my pursuit of u4ea. Barely anything
has been written about this famous troll—and for a good
reason.
Trolling in the 1990s followed a different vector toward
anonymity, as well. Outside of these elite, hidden hacker wars,
ordinary users got their first bitter taste of trolling on Usenet,
the seminal mega-message board. In 1979, the Internet existed
as an academic and military network—the ARPANET—and
access was limited to a select few. Naturally, a few engineers
built a new system, Usenet, which they conceived of as the
“poor man’s ARPANET.” Initially invented for the sole 
purpose of discussing obscure technical matters, it quickly
mushroomed—much to everyone’s surprise—to include hundreds of lists with spirited and, at times, ferocious discussions.
Technical subject matter was complemented by groups devoted
to sex, humor, recipes, and (naturally) anti-Scientology.
Usenet and other mailing lists are also where the term “troll”
first came into common usage. It referred to people who did
not contribute positively to discussions, who argued for the
sake of arguing, or who were simply disruptive jerks (intentionally or not). List users frequently admonished others to
“stop feeding the trolls,” a refrain still commonly seen today on
mailing lists, message boards, and website comment sections.
But Usenet also bred and fed the spectacular breed of troll
who would intentionally sabotage conversations—leaving
both list members and, especially, list administrators, exasperated. There is no better example than Netochka Nezvanova,
named after the titular character in Dostoevsky’s (failed) first
attempt at a novel. Appropriately, the name means “nameless nobody.” And, just like Anonymous today, it is believed
that many different individuals and groups have taken up the
moniker, making it an apt example of what media scholar
Marco Deseriis describes as a “multiple use name,” in which
“the same alias” is adopted by “organized collectives, affinity
groups, and individual authors.”17
Netochka Nezvanova’s artist statement, published online,
captures the mad, spirited flair driving this character:
InterBody—Artistic Statement
Internet—where one may access the proposal + pertinent
materials
Our bodies are the borders of our understanding.
The universes are the body. The Internet is the skin.
This is my Inter Body. I am Soft Wear.

Upon reading this, you might like find yourself, as I did,
digging her imaginative, Deleuzian sensibilities—unless you
were on one of the mailing lists she demolished. Her character
disrupted so frequently, with such adroitness, and on so many
disparate lists and news groups, that different list administrators banded together on a dedicated list of their own, with
the sole purpose of dealing with the trail of destruction she
left behind. At my own current home university, McGill, she
participated in a mailing list about Max, a visual programming language for music, audio, and media, but was booted
in 2001 after threatening to sue particular list members. Here
is a portion of the rationale for banning her:
Second, after “she” was thrown off the McGill list, “she”
intiated [sic] what could best be described as a terror campaign that included spam to anyone who posted to the Max
list, denial of service attacks, and threatening and slanderous email sent to random individuals at McGill. I didn’t see
any point to subjecting myself and my co-workers to this
type of harrassment [sic]. However, it turns out that many
of these acts are felonies. If this behavior recommences, the
victims of the behavior can pursue legal remedies, and I
would strongly suggest they do so.
In reaction, someone on the list cried foul: “So, censorship
once more.”18
In the 1990s, Usenet and many other booming mailing lists
encouraged unrestrained free speech—and were celebrated 
for it. But trolls like Netochka forced a debate, still with us
today, about the limits of such speech: should mailing lists
and webpage moderators curb offensive speech for the sake
of civility, seen by some as necessary for a healthy community? Or should lists avoid censoring speech, no matter how
objectionable, so that the Internet might be a place where free
speech reigns unconditionally?
Of particular note—as we trace our trolling lineage through
time—is the development of 4chan, an imageboard modeled
on a popular Japanese imageboard called Futaba Channel,
also known as 2chan (“chan” is short for “channel”). It is
here, perhaps more than anywhere else, where the populist type of trolling that is well known today first emerged.
4chan is unique for its culture of extreme permissibility
—making questions of free speech largely irrelevant—
fostered by a culture of anonymity embraced by its users.
Naturally, it was on this board where the collective idea
and identity of Anonymous emerged. Unlike Usenet, no one
on 4chan is in the least bit disturbed by the uncivil speech
that ricochets across the board every second of the day. In
many respects, the board is explicitly conceived of as a sayanything zone: the grosser and more offensive, damn it,
the better.
Since it launched in 2003, 4chan has become an immensely
popular, iconic, and opprobrious imageboard. Composed
of over sixty (at the time if this writing) topic-based forums
ranging from anime to health and fitness, it is both the source
of many of the Internet’s most beloved cultural artifacts (such
as Lolcats memes), and one of its most wretched hives of
scum and villainy. The “Random” forum, also called “/b/,”
teems with pornography, racial slurs, and a distinctive brand
of humor derived from defilement. It is where trolling once
flourished. One “/b/tard” (as the forum’s denizens are called)
explained to my class that “everyone should have a good
sense that /b/ is an almost completely unfiltered clusterfuck of
everything you could imagine, and lots of stuff you couldn’t

imagine or wouldn’t want to.” A post might include a naked
woman with the demand: “rate my wife.” The next post might
feature a particularly hard-to-stomach image of a severely
mutilated body, but might then be followed by a nugget
of light humor:

Generally speaking, though, much of the material is designed
to be shocking to outsiders, a discursively constructed
border fence meant to keep the uninitiated—aka “n00bs” or
“newfags”—far, far away. (Nearly every category of person,
from old-timers to new-timers, is labelled a “fag.” On 4chan,
it is both an insult and term of endearment. We will see the
suffix many times in this book.) For insiders, it is the normal
state of affairs, and one of the board’s defining and appealing
qualities.
On 4chan, participants are strongly discouraged from identifying themselves, and most post under the default name
“Anonymous,” as in the example above. Technically, 4chan 
keeps logs of IP addresses and doesn’t do anything to keep
visitors from being identified. Unless users cloak their IP
addresses before connecting, the site’s founder, owner, and
system administrator—Chris Poole, aka “moot”—has full
access to them. He has even given them over to law enforcement to comply with legitimate investigations. (This policy is
widely known among users.) But, in at least a practical sense
(and at least between its users as peers), the board functions
anonymously; except for rare exceptions, and the occasional
instance where a subject of discussion must be identified using
a photograph with a time stamp, users interact with no consistent nicknames or usernames. Posts are pushed off the front
page very quickly—to be deleted from the server when they
reach page 14—only surviving as long as users remain interested in the subject. It “lowers personal responsibility and
encourages experimentation,” as media scholar Lee Knuttila
put it.19 Experimentation includes generating memes (these
are modifications of humorous images, videos, or catchphrases, some of which attain legendary status), fierce trolling
campaigns masterminded by Anonymous (though this has
been less common in recent years), and incessant taunting and
vitriol of other users (such as egging on individuals with suicidal ideation to “just do it” and become “an hero”). It must
be noted, however, that there is also an outpouring of compassionate and empathetic advice, especially for those looking
for relationship help, or when someone discovers a video
of a cat being tortured. But this aspect is rarely featured in
the news.
All this occurs with the knowledge of impermanence. In
contrast to mailing lists or many other kinds of online boards,
there is no official archive. If a thread is not “bumped” back
to the top by a time reply, it dies and evaporates. On an active
channel, like /b/, this entire life cycle occurs in just minutes.
In this environment, it is difficult for a person to accrue
status or reputation—much less fame. Against this backdrop
of cacophonous experimentation and ephemera, a robust
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 43
44 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
collective memory and identity has nevertheless formed around
legendary trolling campaigns, all sorts of insider jokes, and
artifacts like image macros. Aesthetically, the more extreme
a piece of content is, the better, for it ensures the interest of
participants, and motivates replies to threads (keeping them
alive). In particularly novel cases, an extreme piece of content
can even circulate beyond the board—to distant lands like
the message board community, reddit, or bodybuilding.com,
and, eventually, mass cultural awareness. Remember, lolcats
got their start on 4chan. Trolls, in particular, focus on the
collective pursuit of epic wins—just one form of content
among many. (To be clear, 4chan houses many trolls, but many
participants steer clear of trolling activity. Still others avoid
activity altogether—they are there as spectators or lurkers.)
It is almost impossible to pinpoint a day or event when trolling on 4chan was born. But by 2006, the name Anonymous
was being used by participants to engage in trolling raids.
These invasions would continue for many years, even after
Anonymous was routinely deployed for activist purposes.
For instance, in 2010 Anonymous sought to “ruin” a preteen
girl named Jessi Slaughter after her homemade video monologues, which had gained some notoriety on tween gossip
site StickyDrama, were posted on 4chan. Anonymous was
stirred to action by Slaughter’s brazen boasts—she claimed
in one video that she would “pop a glock in your mouth and
make a brain slushie”—and published her phone number,
address, and Twitter username, inundating her with hateful
emails and threatening prank calls, circulating photoshopped
images of her and satiric remixes of her videos. When her
father recorded his own rant, claiming to have “backtraced”
her tormenters and reported them to the “cyber police,” he
also became an object of ridicule. Slaughter, described by /b/
tards as a “lulzcow … whore,” is now memorialized on Urban
Dictionary as “The epitome of an eleven year old slut/poser/
internet reject/scenecore wannabe.”
On the one hand, outlandish trolling raids and denigrating 
statements like “lulzcow … whore” (or “due to fail and AIDS”
from the Habbo Hotel raids) function for 4chan users like
a repellent meant to keep naive users far away from their
Internet playground. On the other, when compared to most
other arenas where trolls are bred—like weev’s GNAA—4chan
is a mecca of populist trolling. By populist, I simply mean that
4chan membership is available to anyone willing to cross these
boundaries, put in the time to learn the argot, and (of course)
stomach the gore. The etiquette and techniques that 4chan
users employ are only superficially elitist. A former student of
mine offered me the following insight. Exceptionally smart, he
was also a troll—or a “goon” to be more precise, since that’s
what they call themselves on Something Awful, his website of
choice at the time:
Something Awful is like the exclusive country club of the
Internet, with a one-time $10 fee, a laundry list of rules
very particular to SA, moderators who ban and probate,
and community enforcement of “Good Posts” through ridicule. 4chan on the other hand is an organic free-for-all that
doesn’t enforce so much as engages an amorphous membership in a mega-death battle for the top humor spot. Anyone
can participate in 4chan, and Internet fame isn’t possible
in the same way it is on SA because everyone is literally
anonymous.
Whatever unfolds on the board—a joke, a long conversation,
or a three-day trolling campaign—anonymity is essential to
4chan; one might call anonymity both its ground rule and
its dominant cultural aspect—a core principle inherited by
Anonymous, even in its pseudonymous, material extension as
hordes of Guy Fawkes–mask wearers. On 4chan, there is an
interplay between the function of anonymity (enabling pure
competition without the interference of reputation or social
capital) and the effects of anonymity (the memes, hacks,
and acts of trolling that emerge and have real impact on the
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 45
46 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
world). In contrast to weev’s egoistic acts of trolling, 4chan’s
Anonymous “Internet Hate Machine” collective action
absolves individuals of responsibility in the conventional
sense, but not in a collective sense.20 That is, Anonymous
is open to anyone willing to subsume him- or herself into a
collective capable of gaining fame through events like the
Habbo Hotel raids. Absent of any individual recognition, each
activity is ascribed to a collective nom de plume, a reincarnation of Netochka Nezvanova. On 4chan, participants will
also shame those seeking fame and attention, calling them
“namefags.”
As a trolling outfit, Anonymous achieved considerable
media notoriety, just like weev. The entity became, in certain
respects, famous. However, while the trolling exploits of, on
the one hand, Anonymous and 4chan users, and on the other
hand, weev, are connected by their tactical approaches, they
are also foils of each other. Regardless of how far and wide the
fame of Anonymous spreads, personal identity and the individual remain subordinate to a focus on the epic win—and,
especially, the lulz.21
This subsumption of individual identity into collective identity is unusual in Western culture. Understanding its uptake is
crucial to our knowledge of how Anonymous, as an activist
group, came to be. It is very possible that the unsavory nature
of Anonymous’s early trolling activities motivated collectivity as a security feature; participants probably had a desire
to participate, to receive payment in lulz, without the risk of
being identified and socially stigmatized. To understand these
motivations, and the powerful significance of an individual’s
willingness to subsume his or her identity, we will briefly
ruminate on the culture of fame-seeking—of individualistic
celebrity—itself.
Anonymous’s Trickster’s Trick: Defying Individual
Celebrity through Collective Celebrity
Fame-seeking pervades practically every sphere of American
life today, from the mass media, which hires Hollywood
celebrities as news anchors, to the micro-media platforms
that afford endless opportunities for narcissism and selfinflation; from the halls of academia, where superstar professors command high salaries, to sports arenas, where players
rake in obscene salaries. Fame-seeking behavior reinforces
what anthropologist David Graeber, building on the seminal
work of C. B. Macpherson, identifies as “possessive individualism,” defined as “those deeply internalized habits of
thinking and feeling” whereby we view “everything around [us]
primarily as actual or potential commercial property.”22
How did 4chan—one of the seediest zones of the Internet—
hatch one of the most robust instantiations of a collectivist,
anti-celebrity ethic, without its members even intending to?
This ethic thrived organically on 4chan because it could be
executed in such an unadulterated form. During a lecture
for my class, a former Anonymous troll and current activist explained the crucial role of 4chan in cementing what he
designates as “the primary ideal of Anonymous”:
The posts on 4chan have no names or any identifiable
markers attached to them. The only thing you are able to
judge a post by is its content and nothing else. This elimination of the persona, and by extension everything associated
with it, such as leadership, representation, and status, is the
primary ideal of Anonymous. (emphasis added)
This Anon, who was lecturing anonymously on Skype to my
ten enraptured students, immediately offered a series of astute
qualifications about this primary ideal: the self-effacement
of the individual. When Anonymous left 4chan in pursuit of
activist goals in 2008, he explained, this ideal failed, often
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 47
48 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
spectacularly; once individuals interacted pseudonymously or
met in person, status-seeking behaviors reasserted themselves.
Individuals jockeyed and jostled for power.
Nevertheless, the taboo against fame-seeking was so well
entrenched on 4chan, and was so valued for its success, that
it largely prevented, with only a few exceptions, these internal struggles for status from spilling over into public quests
for personal fame. (Later, we will see its greatest failure in
the micro-ecologies of hacker teams like AntiSec and LulzSec,
analogous to rock stars in their ability to amass fame and
recognition, and—not surprisingly—to spark the ire of some
Anons, even while being admired for their lulzy and political
antics.)
Once Anonymous left 4chan to engage in activism, the anticelebrity-seeking ideal became “more nuanced … incarnating
into the desire for leaderlessness and high democracy,” as this
Anon put it. Attempts to put these principles into practice also
resulted in missteps, particularly in the emergence of small
teams with concentrations of power.
But despite the fragmentation into teams and cabals,
the overarching ideals remained in play. Adherence meant
“that anybody [could] call themselves Anonymous and
rightfully claim the name,” as the lecturer explained. This
freedom to take the name and experiment with it is precisely
what enabled Anonymous to become the wily hydra it is
today.
But if we peek behind the ideal—the notion that Anonymous
is everyone’s property, an identity commons, so to speak—we
see a much more complicated reality. And it was here, on this
nuanced point, that this Anon ended his micro-lecture. I believe
my students were both mesmerized and shocked that someone
from Anonymous could be so smart and eloquent; I explained
to them that Anonymous can be understood as what anthropologist Chris Kelty has jokingly called, contra the subaltern,
the “superaltern”: those highly educated geeks who not only
speak for themselves but talk back loudly and critically to 
those who purport to speak for them.23 The Anonymous guest
lecturer continued:
Most of us are humor-driven. So it should be no surprise that
we often contend with other Anon-claiming groups we find
out of favor, such as … the new activist-only Occupy Wall
Street anons, or the conspiracy theorists and other overly
serious entities claiming the name. It’s true. We cannot deny
them the name. But the important thing to take away from
this talk is that nowhere in the Anonymous ideal was it ever
stipulated that Anonymous must stand together with or
even like other Anonymous. In fact, animosity and downright wars between Anonymous-claiming entities is right in
line with the original internet-based projects carried out by
cultural Anons.
It is here that we might comprehend the complexity of
Anonymous. There is a singular subject and idea animating
its spirit, and participants attempt to present this in a united
front. For the media, it is tempting to buy into this branding wholesale—to present Anonymous as its values and its
packaging. But the reality of the group’s composition, in all
its varied hues and tones, is impossible to present in any single
sketch, even if Anonymous uses a single name. Its membership comprises too many different networks and working
groups, each of which is at varying odds with one another
in varying moments. The very nature of this collective of collectives means that the accumulation of too much power and
prestige—especially at a single point in (virtual) space—is not
only taboo but also functionally difficult.
4chan was ground zero for a robust anti-celebrity ethic, a
value system opposed to self-aggrandizement and the apparatus of the mainstream media (one of the cancers killing
/b/, as Anonymous likes to say). This ethic carried over to
the activist incarnation of Anonymous. It is in these alternative practices of sociality—upending the ideological divide

between individualism and collectivism—that we can recognize trolling’s development into a principled weapon against
monolithic banks and sleazy security firms. Collectivity
is growing its market share: from the counter–corporatecontrolled globalization movement of a decade ago, to
Anonymous and the recent explosion of leaderless movements
like Occupy. This is often entirely lost on the mainstream
media, which can’t—or won’t—write a story that does not
normalize the conversion of an individual into a celebrity or
leader, complete with individual heroism or tragic moral failings. This, of course, is not the proclivity of journalism and
journalists alone. Most of Western philosophy, and in turn,
much of Western culture more generally, has posited the
self—the individual—as the site of epistemic inquiry. It is
hard to shake millenia of philosophical thinking on a topic—
intellectual thinking that is also cultural common sense.
It is for this reason that Anonymous, whether in its trolling
or activist incarnations, acted as a jujitsu-like force of trickery,
its machinations incommensurable with the driving logic of
the mainstream corporate media and dominant sensibilities of
the self. It drove journalists a bit batty—which I got to witness
first hand as I brokered, a bit trickster-like myself, between
Anonymous and the media. I often helped the media cross the
deep chasm in baby steps, as they tried to locate a leader, or
at least a character, who might satisfy the implicit demands of
their craft.
It is perhaps due to this very resistance to journalistic
convention—to the desire to discover, reveal, or outright
create a celebrity leader—that journalists were compelled to
cover Anonymous. The hunt for a spokesperson, a leader, a
representative, was in vain—at least, until the state entered
the fray and began arresting hackers. But, for the most part,
media outlets were offered few easy characters around which
to spin a story.
What began as a network of trolls has become, for the
most part, a force for good in the world. The emergence of 
Anonymous from one of the seediest places on the Internet is
a tale of wonder, of hope, and of playful illusions. Is it really
possible that these ideals of collectivity and group identification, forged as they were in the hellish, terrifying fires of
trolling, could transcend such an originary condition? Did
the cesspool of 4chan really crystallize into one of the most
politically active, morally fascinating, and subversively salient
activist groups operating today? Somewhat surprisingly, yes.
Let’s see how.
On Trolls, Tricksters, and the Lulz 51
chapter 2
Project Chanology—I Came for the
Lulz but Stayed for the Outrage
Various contingencies converged to awaken the trickster-trolls from their unsavory 4chan underworld.
But if we were to single out one event most responsible for this, it would be the leaking onto the Internet of a
Scientology video featuring Tom Cruise, Scientology’s celebrity of celebrities. “Streisand was in full effect,” quipped one
Anon. “The Streisand Effect” is a well-known Internet phenomenon wherein an attempt to censor a piece of information
has the inverse effect: more people want to see it in order to
understand the motivation for the censorship, and thus it
spreads much more widely than it would have if left alone.
The phenomenon is named after Barbra Streisand’s attempt
in 2003 to bar, via a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, aerial
photographs of her Malibu home from being published. The
photographer was only trying to document coastal erosion.
Before the lawsuit, the image of her home had been viewed
online only six times, but after the case went public, more than
420,000 people visited the site. The Tom Cruise Scientology
video was subject to a similar dynamic; its circulation was
unstoppable.
In the video, Tom Cruise epitomizes Scientology’s narcissistic worldview: “Being a Scientologist … when you drive
by an accident, it’s not like anyone else,” he says, chuckling 
54 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
with self-satisfaction. “As you drive past you know you have
to do something about it, because you know you’re the only
one that can really help.” Internet geeks (along with almost
everyone else) viewed the video as a pathetic (not to mention
hilarious) attempt to bestow credibility on pseudoscience
via celebrity. As Tom Cruise cackled to himself in the video,
the Internet community cackled—albeit for very different
reasons—with him.
The video initially reached the Internet not through the
efforts of Anonymous, but through (fittingly enough) an anonymous leak. The video was originally slated to appear on NBC
to coincide with the release of Tom Cruise’s unauthorized
biography, but at the last minute the network got cold feet.
However, critics of Scientology worked swiftly to ensure that
the video found its way onto the web. Former Scientologist
Patty Moher, working alongside longtime critic Patricia
Greenway, FedExed a copy to Mark Bunker, who uploaded a
video and sent a link to investigative journalist Mark Ebner,
who in turn sent it to other news sources. Gawker, Radar, and
other sites picked it up on January 13, 2008, linking to a video
Bunker had posted—he thought—with password protection.
He was wrong. “I woke up a few hours later to discover that
the one chapter that had Cruise’s monologue was accidentally not set to ‘private,’” he said later. “It had been viewed
about 20,000 times while I slept and was downloaded and
mirrored multiple times on multiple accounts by people who
had read the Gawker and Radar stories and other coverage of
the video.”1
 YouTube subsequently removed Bunker’s videos
hosted on the channel “TomCruiseBook”—along with the
entire channel—likely at the behest of a Scientology copyright
notice.
On January 15, Gawker republished the video with a short,
punchy description fit for millions of eyeballs: “Let me put it
this way: if Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah’s couch was an 8
on the scale of scary, this is a 10.” The Religious Technology
Center—the arm of Scientology dealing with matters of 
intellectual property—took immediate action, threatening
publishers with lawsuits if they did not remove the video.
Gawker ended its article boldly: “it’s newsworthy; and we will
not be removing it.”2
 The cat was out of the bag, Scientology
was furious (and about to furiously unfurl lawsuits), and then
all hell broke loose when the “hive,” as Anonymous was then
often called, decided to get involved.
On January 15, at 7:37:37 pm, the gates of the underworld
opened with a historic thread regarding Scientology-oriented
activism:

Technically—and geeks make it a habit to geek out on technical specificities—a call-to-arms post came earlier on 4chan
as well as on 711chan (apparently at 6:11 pm, I was told).
Nevertheless, this seemed to be the post that spurred the largest
number of trolls into action. While the general mood of the
thread was one of (hyperbolic) confidence and exuberance, 
56 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
others were understandably skeptical about taking on—much
less taking down—this extraordinarily powerful organization.
They were well aware that targeting the Church of Scientology
might be (invoking Tom Cruise’s blockbuster movie series)
“mission impossible”:

gathered under the slogan “CHANOLOGY”—and outlined
the events to come:
Faster than anyone could say “Hail Xenu” (Xenu being the
dastardly, evil alien overlord of the galaxy, at least according to Scientology’s version of history), these trolls—followed
by myself shortly thereafter—headed to the Partyvan IRC
network (an Anon hangout) to watch the trolling festivities
“explode.” Or, at least, that’s how a core participant described
it in a lecture to one of my university classes:

On 15/1/08 war was beginning.
Scientology’s site is already under heavy
bombardment, it’s loading quite slowly.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg, the first assault
in many to follow. We’re winning a minor victory, but
without the united support of the chans, Scientology
will brush off this attack - and it will be doomed to
nothing more than an entry in ED.
4chan, answer the call! Join the legion against Scientology, help in its
demise, in its long awaited doom! For decades this tyrrany has existed,
corrupting the minds of the weak- although hilarious, it’s rather pathetic.
We must destroy this evil, and replace it with a greater one - CHANOLOGY
For when we are victorious, the chans will stand united in a new chapter of

The unified bulk of anonymous collaborated through
massive chat rooms to engage in various forms of ultracoordinated motherfuckery. For very short periods of time
between January 15th and the 23rd, Scientology websites
were hacked and DDoS’ed to remove them from the Internet.
The Dianetics telephone hotline was completely bombarded
with prank calls. All-black pieces of paper were faxed to
every fax number we could get our hands on. And the
“secrets” of their religion were blasted all over the Internet.
I also personally scanned my bare ass and faxed it to them.
Because fuck them.
Watching this epic raid take shape in real time, it was easy for
me to understand why the geeks and hackers making up the
ranks of Anonymous targeted Scientology: it is their evil doppelgänger. I did not end up in this IRC channel by accident—I
was already immersed in the cultural tensions between geeks/
netizens and Scientologists. One year earlier, I had been living
in Edmonton, one of Canada’s coldest cities in (what felt like)
the furthest reaches of North America, culling and collating
material in the world-class Scientology archive assembled
by Stephen Kent, a sociology professor at the University of
Alberta. I was there to research an epic battle between geeks
and the Church of Scientology that began in the early 1990s and
spanned two decades, starting after the Church of Scientology
targeted its critics, especially those who leaked secret scripture.
Humorously dubbed “Internet vs. Scientology,” the battle was
waged both offline and online between netizens—wholly committed to free speech—and the Church of Scientology—wholly
committed to stamping it out by using any means necessary
(legal or illegal) to censor criticism and prevent leaked documents from circulating online. I had arrived with a cultural
hypothesis: hackers and Scientology stand in a diametrically
opposed relationship to each other. This is not only because
they are different, but because they are so precisely different.
They are mirror images of each other, the perfect foils.
Consider the central doctrine espoused by Keeping
Scientology Working, a publication of the Church’s Religious
Technology Center. The prose functions like a rusted first
generation robot that has lurched into a corner and, finding
itself unable to turn around, continues plodding forward
while monotonously droning:
ONE: HAVING THE CORRECT TECHNOLOGY.
TWO: KNOWING THE TECHNOLOGY.
THREE: KNOWING IT IS CORRECT.
FOUR: TEACHING CORRECTLY THE CORRECT
TECHNOLOGY.
FIVE: APPLYING THE TECHNOLOGY.
SIX: SEEING THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS
CORRECTLY APPLIED.
SEVEN: HAMMERING OUT THE EXISTENCE OF
INCORRECT TECHNOLOGY.
EIGHT: KNOCKING OUT INCORRECT
APPLICATIONS.
NINE: CLOSING THE DOOR ON ANY POSSIBILITY
OF INCORRECT TECHNOLOGY.
TEN: CLOSING THE DOOR ON INCORRECT
APPLICATION.
Reading these maxims in 2007, I knew that any hacker or geek
who laid eyes on them would be simultaneously entertained and
offended. Where Scientology is shrouded in secrecy, steeped in
dogma, and dependent on the deployment of (pseudo)science
and (faux) technology to control people, hacking lives in the
light of inquisitive tinkering and exploration enables, and is
enabled by, science and technology. Hackers dedicate their
lives and pour their souls into creating and programming the
world’s most sophisticated machines. They are quintessential
craftsman—motivated by a desire for excellence—but they
abhor the idea of a single “correct technology.” In fact, hacking
is where craft and craftiness intermingle: make a 3-D printer
Project Chanology 59
60 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
that prints a 3-D printer; assemble an army of zombie computers into a botnet and then steal another hacker’s botnet
to make yours more powerful; design a robot solely for the
purposes of mixing cocktails and showcase it at Roboexotica,
a festival for cocktail robotics held since 1999; invent a programming language called Brainfuck designed to, well, mess
with the heads of anyone who tries to program with it. You
get the picture.
A religion which claims a privileged access to science and
technology, to the extent of declaring themselves “the only
group on Earth that has a workable technology which handles
the basic rules of life itself and brings order out of chaos,”3
 is
deeply offensive to hackers whose only demand on technology
is that it should, at minimum, actually do something—a task
they leave not to some transcendent discovery of truth but,
instead, to their personal ingenuity in discovering solutions
to technical problems, with the help of shared tips, swapped
ideas, and reams of borrowed code.
So it made a lot of sense that Anonymous, composed of
geeks and hackers, would rise against Scientology. But something was unclear: was Anonymous simply trolling for its
own lulzy amusement or was it earnestly protesting? Even if
I was pretty certain these were not deliberate acts of activism, a political spirit was clearly wafting through IRC. People
were undeniably, and royally, pissed off that Scientology
dared to censor a video on “their” Internet—especially such
a hilarious one. Anons were phone-pranking the Dianetics
hotline and sending scores of unpaid pizza to Church centers,
sharing their exploits in real time across 4chan. At first any
political aim seemed incidental. And then, weeks later, one
particular act of “ultracoordinated motherfuckery” gave way
to an earnest—though still, undoubtedly, irreverent—activist
endeavor.
As Chanology grew in popularity, its bustling IRC channels
#xenu and #target became unsuitable working environments
for the publicity stunts and outreach to which it aspired. 
Three people broke away and started and IRC channel #press.
Soon after, it grew to include eight members who worked
one evening until daybreak to create what still qualifies as
Anonymous’s best-known work of art. (Eventually, the team
grew in size, #press became chaotic and members split off yet
again. They called themselves marblecake, after one of their
own found inspiration in the baked item he was eating.)
If the Tom Cruise video struck a chord both humorous and
hyperbolic, this team harmonized to create an ironic video
whose tone embodied a trickster-like ambiguity: simultaneously hilarious and serious, playful and ominous. Much to
everyone’s surprise, the video catapulted Anonymous onto a
new plane of existence.
In the video, a drab corporate glass building stands against
a backdrop of ominously racing dark clouds. A speech begins
which, while delivered by a robotic voice, is poetic and
inspirational:
For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind,
and for our own enjoyment, we shall proceed to expel you
from the Internet, and systematically dismantle the Church
of Scientology in its present form.
We recognize you as a serious opponent, and do not
expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame.
However, you will not prevail forever against the angry
masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your
hypocrisy, and the general lawlessness of your organization
have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide,
because we are everywhere. You have no recourse in attack,
because for each of us that falls, ten more will take his place.
We are cognizant of the many who may decry our methods
as parallel to those of the Church of Scientology, those who
espouse the obvious truth that your organization will use
the actions of Anonymous as an example of the persecution
of which you have, for so long, warned your followers—this
is acceptable to Anonymous. In fact, it is encouraged.

It was earnest—but earnestly a joke. This poetic imagery of a
rising-up was rhetoric—but it was so compelling, so enticing as
a lulzy direction, that it entrapped the Anonymous trolls into
a commitment to the systematic dismantling of Scientology.
They got caught up—like so many tricksters before them—in
their own trickster trap. Anonymous, in its sudden commitment to a lulzy politics, gave birth to the reviled “moralfags”
and “leaderfags.” These Anons—tainted, somehow, by an accidental taste for justice—effectively catalyzed one of the most
potent protest movements of our times.
The accidental train of events went like this: The video
unexpectedly sparked a debate as to whether Anons should
hit the streets to protest the Church or remain faithful to their
madcap roots in raids and lulz. The timing helped make the
decision for them, tipping things in favor of street demonstrations. Gregg Housh, one of the video’s editors and an original
member of marblecake, explained it as follows during an
interview: “There were people who didn’t think anonymous
or 4chan should take to the streets but the consensus to actually do it came relatively easily for us after the video. It seemed
to be great timing, the right video at the right moment.”
Even if Anons were leaning toward protest, they did not
want to ditch trolling completely; rather, they wanted to
expand their repertoire. One Anon on IRC captured the full
spectrum—legal, illegal, lulzy, serious—that these hordes of
trolls were increasingly inhabiting (or wanting to inhabit)
between mid-January 2008 and the first street protest (her
pseudonym has been changed):
<Lulamania>: The ultimate scenario: Anonymous prank call + DDoS,
US and French Government renew fraud charges, tax evasions, and
illegal activities charges, local Church pastors telling their congregation the evils of Scientology, former members and families interviewed
on TV about experience, activist groups holding licensed rallies and
protests, and the news covering all of the above …
<Lulamania>: Keep in mind this is a war of attrition. We cannot 
bankrupt Scientology directly—this is about getting media attention,
informing the public, wearing down their members, pissing off their
IT/phone services, counter-brainwashing their potential recruits, and
for lulz.
On January 24, 2008, Anonymous announced that February
10 would be a day of protest. A few days after this initial call to
action, Scientology critic Mark Bunker seized the high octane
moment to push for the use of legal tactics alone. Like the
trickster of communication and crossroads, Eshu, he reached
out to the trolls in a video (holy Xenu!), praised them (smart),
and asked them to join the cause (holy Xenu!). His message
was to simmer the hell down, rein in the lulz, and please,
please refrain from anything straight-up illegal. On a lengthy
post to a forum on whyweprotest.net, Bunker explained what
motivated him to make the video: “After seeing Anonymous’s
‘Message to Scientology’ I was worried that I had helped to
spawn attacks that would potentially scare Scientology staffers and also get Anonymous members in legal trouble so I
decided I needed to make my initial tape to Anonymous.”4
Although many had already been thinking along these lines,
not everyone was on board with the vision offered by this
hefty, bear-like man in his fifties whom Anonymous renamed
“Wise Beard Man” for his erudite posturing and white facial
hair. (Only a few years later, new activist networks would arise
that embraced militant, illegal digital tactics like the DDoS,
not for trolling but for political dissent.) Nevertheless, enough
of them shifted gears and darted down the path of activism;
Bunker’s arguments nudged Anonymous toward the use of
(mostly) legal tactics for its first major demonstrations.
The cake of marble, beavering away largely in secret (a
cohort of outsiders knew of its existence), was aware that the
great majority of potential participants were likely protest
neophytes. If these Internet nerds, geeks, hackers, and trolls
showed up en masse to protest without any prior activist
experience, it would almost certainly be a recipe for ruin. So
Project Chanology 63
64 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
they had to get them up to speed—and rather quickly. They
delivered a crash course on the mechanics, challenges, and
components of peaceful protest in a video called “Code of
Conduct.”5
 Posted on February 1, 2008, a robotic voice lists
twenty-two rules. No detail is overlooked: the video reminds
participants to wear comfortable shoes, drink plenty of water,
keep particularly geeky and objectionable Internet jokes
to themselves (because these would likely offend bystanders), refrain from any violence, obtain necessary permits, use
catchy slogans, and record the event. Since marblecake knew
that Scientologists would use all available means—including
high-definition photos—to identify and subsequently harass
protesters, one rule exhorted participants to cover their faces,
but noted, in a statement that now appears ironic, that there
was no need to use masks: “Rule #17: Cover your face. This
will prevent your identification from videos taken by hostiles,
other protesters, or security. Use scarves, hats, and sunglasses.
Masks are not necessary, and donning them in the context of a
public demonstration is forbidden in some jurisdictions.”
Necessary or not, as thousands of Anons and supporters hit
the streets in cities around the world, masks appeared everywhere. By then, the Guy Fawkes mask was a pop cultural icon
thanks to the Hollywood blockbuster V for Vendetta. The
movie portrays a lone anarchist’s fight against a dystopian,
Orwellian state. The mask had also appeared previously on
4chan, worn by a beloved meme character with a penchant
for failure—Epic Fail Guy. Well known, easy to purchase,
and imbued with an undeniable symbolic energy—both on
account of its history and its more recent iteration—the Guy
Fawkes mask became the mask de jour to deter the prying
eyes of Scientology. After, it would function as Anonymous’s
signature icon.
The day’s events straddled the line between serious political protest and carnivalesque shenanigans. Why did so many
people show up? During an informal chat, one long-time
Anon and member of marblecake reasoned to me (correctly, I 
think) that “hearing [about] the first reports of east Australian
protests on February 10, 2008, really set things in motion
… Had those not materialized I figure the turnout elsewhere
wouldn’t have been as important.” While much of the Western
world slumbered, in Australia an estimated 550 to 850 protesters poured into the streets, conveying their numbers in real
time to others in video clips and photos, setting off a domino
effect felt across much of the Western world. In London the
crowd swelled to six hundred, and this success was matched
in North America, where protesters hit the streets in small
cities across the heartland and in major metropolitan centers
like Los Angeles, where a whopping one thousand people
turned out.
Six months after a local Fox News station labeled Anonymous
“the Internet Hate Machine,” they had legions of followers in
the streets—not just geeks and hackers hammering at their
keyboards—who were seizing on the group’s name, its ethic
of anonymity, and assorted concomitant iconography. That
evening, men and women in Guy Fawkes masks and black
suits with signs announcing “We Are the Internet” could be
seen on cable news shows around the world.
While this may have been the first time Anons demonstrated
in large numbers in the streets, previous trolling campaigns
had a quasi-activist flair. For instance, in 2007 Anonymous
targeted right-wing radio personality Hal Turner, not only
for lulz (and revenge) but also because he was a “racist.”
Anonymous had first targeted him in 2006 with a series of
prank phone calls and computer attacks that took down his
website. Hal Turner countered by publishing the numbers of
the prank callers, prompting Anonymous to hit hard at the
heart of his radio empire, trolling and hacking the heck out
of him. The following blog post, published by an Anonymous
participant before the second round of raids, conveys the
undeniable political sensibility compelling the action:
Project Chanology 65
66 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Those of you who spend any time around the troll pits of the
internet, such as 4chan, 7chan, YTMND etc will undoubtedly know of this already, but its worth repeating.
Hal Turner is, in short a Nazi [sic]. A Nazi with his own
radio show. Unfortunately for him, he also hasn’t really got
a mass following, except from the /b/tards and other various
trolls, who decided to absolutely ruin his life online. As the
Fox News below [sic] clip of him advocating the murder of
a US judge shows, he isn’t exactly someone to feel sorry for.6
Chanology differed from these previous raids in one crucial
respect: it became a permanent fixture in the political landscape. In the weeks and months following the first street
demonstrations, Chanology continued to protest Scientology’s
relentless legal and extralegal crackdown on critics and those
who dared to disclose or circulate internal documents. As one
protester explained to me during a street demonstration in
Ireland: “Came for the lulz; stayed for great justice, epic win,
and moar lulz.” But why? How did such a chaotic ensemble organize themselves? And could the lulz still thrive when
seeking justice?
Why (and How) We Protest
Every time I reflect on the constitution and perseverance of
Chanology, it strikes me as a minor miracle in the annals of
political resistance. To be sure, a subset of trolling (like the Hal
Turner raids) struck a political chord, but the energy behind
these early raids tended to dissipate after a few days or weeks.
Chanology was sustained in an environment not exactly conducive to long-term deliberate political organizing; it behooves
us to consider the social dynamics behind Chanology’s success,
especially in light of the many tensions—for instance, between
lulz-driven action and moral goals—which bedeviled it from
the start.
To begin with, the formation of a sustained political will was
secured by the widespread media coverage of the February
street demonstrations. From the first day, people in Guy
Fawkes masks were all over the news. Hundreds of photos
and dozens of homemade videos from local protests were
shared through IRC and popular social media sites like Digg,
Myspace, Yahoo! Groups, and LiveJournal. For many Anons,
the external representations validated Project Chanology
and Anonymous. This dynamic of success and amplification
repeated many times in the organization’s history.
Also significant were ulterior motives: while activism was a
significant factor for many Anons (and the lulz were always
enticing), many turned out for the rare opportunity to meet
some of their Anonymous brethren. Some stayed, others
returned to their dark corners of the Internet and contested this
incipient political sensibility, sometimes deriding their peers
as “moralfags” and redoubling their trolling—even targeting
Chanology itself as a source of lulz. Take, for instance, the
following proposal—a call to reclaim Anonymous from the
moralfags in order to resurrect the Internet Hate Machine—
proposed on Chanology’s very active virtual town square, the
web forum Enturbulation.org (which was eventually ported
to WhyWeProtest):
Fellow brothers and sisters,
Six months ago we started on a jihad to ensure that our
internets would be free of faggotry. A call to arms went out
and we answered it as legion. Today, when looking back at
our naïve efforts it is obvious that what is ours by right has
been stolen from us.
Our name, our memes and our efforts have been hijacked
by people who do not understand and do not realize that
our strength came from being diverse, uncaring and unrelenting. While normally this would not be an issue those
who have stayed in the trenches protecting our ideals are
now at an impasse.
Project Chanology 67

We need your help, I am bent on hand and foot [sic] asking
that those that have left Project Chanology return and
reclaim it. Bring back the lulz, bring back the hate machine,
do not let some rather forceful detractors sway you.
We started this to ensure our internets were free from
tyranny and while I agree there are fights ahead that maybe
[sic] more important to this end, this is the first one. Where
we mold the newfags into hardened trolls and ensure that
when the man comes to claim what is rightfully free we are
all well versed in ensuring that cannot happen.
Over the coming weeks you will see some old faces
raid your channels, your boards, your IRCs to ensure that
Anonymous retains what is ours. Reclaim Chanology once
and for all, burn anything that opposes us to the ground.7
The binary between moralfags and “hardened” lulz-seekers
was, and still is, less clear-cut than this post suggests. On the
IRC channels dedicated to political organizing, a small but
rather vocal minority offered technical aid for political gain
while also insisting on lulzy action, including horrific forms of
trolling. Among these trolls, a single individual, named CPU
(not his real name), stood out. Widely considered a talented
hacker, he freely offered technical advice. But he was also a
fierce critic of the moralfags and would clamor for vicious
forms of trolling. For instance: on March 16, 2008, CPU suggested the following on the IRC channel #internethatemachine,
a chat room for criticizing the moralfags (all names have been
changed):
<CPU>: Internethatemachine is for those sick of the moralfags and
the lovefags am i rite lol?
<CPU>: We should just hit a random forum for the lulz. Anyone
remember the emetophobia raids?
<CPU>: I’m searching for a forum lol.
<CPU>: oh lol http://www.suicideforum.com/
<CPU>: First person to push someone to the edge wins?
<CPU>: Who remembers happy tree friends? :p
<CPU>: We trashed the forums every day for about 2 weeks lol.

Whether CPU and the others on the channel went on to execute
this campaign is unknown—but someone did. On March 22,
2012, trolls engaged in one of the most morally reprehensible
and notorious attacks to date, invading an epilepsy forum and
posting bright flashing images which induced seizures among
some of the forum’s members. Nearly every piece of reporting
incorrectly attributed the attack to Anons fighting Scientology,
which was not likely the case; various threads on different
image boards blamed another notorious board infested with
trolls: eBaum’s world. Even if Chanology was not behind the
attack, the raid left a dark stain on the name Anonymous,
infuriating some members of Chanology.8
It must be noted that while the anti-Scientology crusaders
were mortified by the epilepsy forum attack, these nascent
moralfags did not altogether disavow deviance or the lulz—
it is, after all, part of the fabric of their culture. Instead,
Chanology dabbled in a kinder, gentler breed of lulz. For
instance, New York City is home to an annual (and rather
sizable) zombie flash mob, whereupon a thousand ghoulish,
bloody, slow-moving, groaning bodies drag (or sometimes
Project Chanology 69
70 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
rollerskate) themselves through the city streets. Chanology
organizers in New York thought it might be lulzy if this zombie
mob paraded in front of the Scientology Church on the day of
Anonymous’s monthly protest there. The zombie mob happily
obliged. They sauntered down 46th Street in slow motion,
yelling obscenities at the Church while the Chanology protesters rofled and snickered at Scientology, obviously proud
of the theatrical (and mostly G-rated) lulz they managed
to stage.
But there is no better example of activist Anons’ engagement of carnivalesque humor than Operation Slickpubes in
January 2009, also orchestrated by the Chanology cell in
New York. It consisted of a nearly naked person (he was partially covered by a veneer of smeared Vaseline and pubic hair)
streaking through a Scientology Org. The aim of this over-thetop endeavor was not simply to antagonize and anger Church
members through an act of defilement (though this was no
doubt part of it), but also to revitalize what some participants
saw as the flagging spirit of the lulz. The forces of Apollo had
to be balanced, eternally, with a bit of Dionysian trickster
revelry. Later, Chanology members wrote about the incident
in a blog post on motherfuckery.org, a site designed to commemorate their roots:
What resulted in the following months could only be described
as “lulz” and “u mad”, as the record of the Slickpubes operation made its rounds throughout the world of Chanology,
anonymous, and the higher ranks of Scientology. Those who
thought Chanology was too tame rejoiced.9
Within this emerging politically oriented Anonymous, the
lulz were often deployed, as in Operation Slickpubes, in a
jocular, Dionysian form: risqué yet also risky. They worked
by simultaneously making one laugh, making one cringe, and
also offering a politics of subversion. But not without consequences. Indeed, in the case of Operation Slickpubes, the 
greasy streaker was arrested for his antics. The incident also
prompted the NYPD to begin secretly monitoring Anonymous
(a necessary baptism for any new political group, and what
better way to attract law enforcement than through pubic
hair?).10 Wise Beard Man may have tamed the Anonymous
trickster, but he did not fully eliminate its mischievous spirit.
Anonymous’s willingness to wreak havoc in pursuit of
lulz and free speech (and in opposition to the malfeasance
and deception of Scientology) calls to mind the nineteenthcentury European “social bandits” described by historian Eric
Hobsbawm in his 1959 book Primitive Rebels. These bandits
are members of mafias, secret societies, religious sects, urban
mobs, and outlaw gangs; they are ultimately thugs, but, according to Hobsbawm, they nurture a faint revolutionary spirit:
some of their plunder is typically redistributed to the poor
who they further protect from bandits other than themselves.
Hobsbawm defines the bandits as “pre-political” figures “who
have not yet found, or only begun to find, a specific language
in which to express their aspirations about the world.”11
Anonymous has worked toward finding that language with
remarkable celerity since it launched Project Chanology.
Such hijinks nevertheless contrast with Hobsbawm’s moral
narrative, whereby bandits can only become viable political
actors by giving up their menacing tactics and buying into
conventional forms of power. For Hobsbawm, the bandit is
pitted against “the forces of the new society which he cannot
understand. At most he can fight it and seek to destroy it.”
This explains why “the bandit is often destructive and savage
beyond the range of his myth.”12 Today’s digital bandits,
however, understand the forces of creative destruction, consciously deploying them for political purposes.
The lulz retained a prominent seat, but not at the head
of the table. Chanology was a far cry from a chaotic horde
of loons. While working in the midst of an often miasmic
environment of drama, in-fighting, and competing groups,
Chanology members developed a strong organization, with
Project Chanology 71
72 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
core participants devoting extraordinary chunks of time
to the endeavor. We can take, as a case study, the software
behind the immensely popular web forum Why We Protest,
largely written by a young French geek named Ravel. He
described joining Chanology as a natural fit, given that he
had “some mischievous years and strong affinities with both
the hacker and freedom of speech cultures. When the call to
action came I didn’t bat an eye and pretty much uttered ‘let’s
do this.’”13 He made it his life project for the next six years
and counting.
The project emerged from the creation of the #website IRC
channel. Ravel (known as Sue) disliked the existing proposals and, in classic hacker style, started to code the software
according to his own vision with the help of two other programmers. Due to his hard work he was tapped to become
part of marblecake:
I was approached and became part of the (unduly) infamous marblecake collective … To date it has been the most
organized group I have collaborated with online. I wouldn’t
exaggerate when saying the quorum of participants spent
over 70 hours a week working on media projects, planning,
PR, and brainstorming. It served both as think tank and production studio. Meetings were held near daily, assessments
were made, notes kept and so forth.14
“What the dicks is marblecake?”:
First Challenges to the New Anonymous
With a sizeable portion of Anons now firmly committed to this
politically engaged style of hacking (complete with a technical
infrastructure of channels, monthly meet-ups at Chanology
events, and an emergent range of memes and objects specific
to activist-Anonymous, like Guy Fawkes masks), it was only a
matter of time before this identity would fracture. Homeostasis 
is not, exactly, the preferred state of Anonymous—certainly
not before Chanology, and definitely not after.
Let’s linger for a moment on Ravel’s characterization of marblecake as “the most organized group I have collaborated with
online.” By all accounts, marblecake was extremely effective in
creating propaganda, issuing press releases, brokering between
city cells, and suggesting themes for monthly protests. Among
other factors, many attributed its success to a skilled organizer
who went by the name of darr. A peer described her to me as
“resolute and fierce, kind and understanding”—qualities the
Anon thought crucial to marblecake’s accomplishments.
But then darr made the mistake of attempting to push
through an unpopular proposal. For the May 2008 protest,
marblecake suggested the theme “Operation Psychout,” to
air Scientology’s human rights abuses in the field of psychiatry, which was “met with a lot of opposition,” explained one
active member to me. Soon after, marblecake hammered the
final nail into its own coffin—at least in the form it existed at
the time—by seeking to “railroad it through,” which led to
Chanology members “taking darr down,” who was seen as a
particularly vocal proponent. Or a “power-hungry wannabee
leaderfag,” as one Anon put it. Trolls, especially, went for the
jugular, doxing her and spreading lies. She quit the project,
never to be seen again.
Marblecake existed in a nebulous zone. When the eight
members had splintered off in January 2008, they left a permanent notification on the chat channel #press: “Want access
to where all the action is? Get your ass on SSL and don’t be a
faggot ; D—Topic set by darr on 16/02/2008.” Those intrigued
by this enticing message could ask an “oldfag” about it—
someone around since the beginning—and be directed through
the steps to set up encryption (SSL). They would also have to
be prepared to clock a lot of long hours. In this way, marblecake grew to include twenty-five participants. Eventually,
the topic message was replaced and growth stagnated—
newcomers had no idea about its existence.
Project Chanology 73
74 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Three months after darr’s outing, someone posted a message
on Why We Protest: “What the dicks is marblecake?” The
answer they received effectively informed a much larger swath
of Anons about the semi-secret project. For many, it revealed
for the first time that multiple factions had developed under
the mantle of Chanology:
I’m in marblecake, and I’ve no interest in being a leaderfag.
I’m happy to answer questions.
The short story is, it is/was a small thinktank that produced media anonymously and secretly. The positive spin
would be that it has “suffered from its own success”—it
produces enough significant media that it desires to remain
completely secret … and producing enough media that the
rest of Anonymous became aware—to varying degrees—
that there is a secret cabal of anons trying to manipulate
things behind the scenes.
The negative spin is … that it’s a secret cabal of anons
trying to manipulate things behind the scenes. And there is
a case to be made that they got a swelled head early. They
produced the original “message to scientology” video (well
before I got involved). They were also led by Darr, who
pissed off the wrong people, has the wrong attitude, and
generally didn’t handle criticism well.
[…]
As far as factions go, there’s marblecake, enturbmods,
OCMB, and the #enturbulation channers (in addition
to each individual city’s cell, and probably many others
I don’t know about). MC and entubmods have battled,
#enturbulation (specifically Tuesday and WB) have battled
with marblecake. OCMB often has drama pour over into
enturbulation. #enturbulation generally hates marblecake. It’s all a bunch of stupid infighting, and many people
have been involved with more than one of those groups.
And nobody should feel “left out” for not being involved
in any of ’em, ’cause they’re all essentially janitors for the 
*real* anons, the ones that are out in cities fliering and
picketing.15
The ensuing thread was long and bitter. Some people were
seething, including some members and ex-members of the
cabal. After this brouhaha, marblecake foundered for a bit
before undergoing what one Anon called “reformation.”
Afterwards, they functioned with more transparency regarding their role as “choreographers,” to borrow the phrase used
by Paolo Gerbaudo to describe a leadership style common
throughout the global protest movements of 2011.16
Marblecake’s outing showed that a simple binary between
leaders and followers failed to capture the complex organizational dynamics in a milieu so committed to decentralization.
Anonymous is not a united front, but a hydra—comprising
numerous different networks. Even within a single project
there are working groups that are often at odds with one
another—not to mention the civil wars between different
nodes of Anonymous more generally. But even if Anons don’t
always agree about what is being done under the auspices of
Anonymous, they tend to respect the fact that anyone can
assume the moniker. The mask, which has become its signature icon, functions as an eternal beacon, broadcasting the
symbolic value of equality, even in the face of bitter divisions and inequalities. Of course, despite the lack of a stable
hierarchy or a single point of control, some Anons are more
active and influential than others—at least for limited periods.
Anonymous abides by a particular strain of what geeks call
“do-ocracy,” with motivated individuals (or those with free
time) extending its networked architecture by contributing
time, labor, and attention to existing endeavors or leaving
others to start ones of their own, aligned better to their ideals
and principles.
Whether a movement even fesses up to the existence of soft
leaders is an important question. It relates to another issue
plaguing many social movements: how does a social movement
Project Chanology 75
76 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
maintain enough permeability that newcomers can join
pre-existing groups, whose tendency is to become cliquish?
Without overt recognition that leadership exists, a project can
fall easily into the “tyranny of structurelessness”—a situation whereby the vocalizing of an ideology of decentralization
works as a platitude that obscures or redirects attention away
from firmly entrenched but hidden nodes of power behind the
scenes.17
Following the heated controversy that erupted on Why We
Protest, many Anons came to accept that marblecake played
a valuable organizational role. The group’s soft leadership
engendered an impressive amount of organization—both
online and in local cities. But the general consensus was in
favor of more transparency.
“There is no way Scientology can win
on us anymore. It is over.”
In 2014, Project Chanology is a shadow of its former self.
Current monthly protests draw only the hardcore, with small
to midsized turnouts in a smattering of cities (like Dublin,
Düsseldorf, Hamburg, and New York). However, this situation reflects not failure, but success. While Project Chanology
did not demolish the Church, it altered the game so fundamentally that critics could now stand confidently under the
sun without fear of reprisal. The Church no longer had the
upper hand.
This point was driven home by numerous ex-Scientologists
during a conference I attended called Dublin Offlines, organized by ex-Scientologists on June 30, 2012. It had been a little
over four years since this unlikely elixir first fomented via a
strange brew of ex-Church members, Scientology critics, and
uppity Internet geeks. This occasion seemed an appropriate
time and place for me to take stock of the projects historical
import.
The conference was held in Dublin’s Teacher’s Club (aka
Club na Múinteoirí), housed in a four-story Georgian building
which provided cozy and intimate shelter from the everpresent Irish drizzle. About seventy folks attended, a sizable
chunk of them wearing Guy Fawkes masks. In keeping with
the theatrics common to street demonstrations, some Anons
from France were dressed with panache in circus and pantomime getups. Two were even dressed as giant leprechauns.My
personal favorite was the guy sporting a cow suit.
Speakers included ex-Scientologists from the Scientology
ship, some from the Sea Org, Gerry Armstrong (the former
personal secretary to L. Ron Hubbard), Jamie DeWolf (the
great-grandson of L. Ron Hubbard), a couple of academics (including myself), and a handful of individuals who had
lost family to the Church. The master of ceremonies was Pete
Griffiths, a local and a former executive director of the Kendal
mission, in Cumbria, England; his shimmering silver suit
perfectly matched his spirited personality.
Since I was staying on the other side town, I arrived a little
late to find the talks already in full swing. I tiptoed in, silently
waved to some of the locals I knew from a previous trip to
Dublin, and slipped into a seat. I felt okay, if certainly undercaffeinated. But by the end of the day, having squirmed in
discomfort during many of the talks, I was left emotionally
drained. The ex-Scientologists provided moving personal
accounts of the cult’s power to strangle the lives of both those
in the Church and those who dared to leave. Church policy
mandates that new recruits sever ties with any family and
friends who object (as many do); leaving the organization is
often a logistical nightmare, since one’s personal network has
been so thoroughly eviscerated. If a member is public about
his or her exit, the member is targeted under the “fair game
policy,” which states that the individual “[m]ay be deprived of
property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without
any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied
to or destroyed.”18

A talk by Tory Christman stood out among the rest. Before
leaving on July 20, 2000, she had been a Scientologist for
thirty-one years, during which period she honed her speaking
skills by performing public relations for the church. Christman
was confident, eloquent, inspirational, and witty; sporting
rectangular glasses and a bright blue suit, she beamed with
energy. She spoke for thirty minutes and packed in a whole
lot: her entry into the Church, some of her less than pleasant
experiences (such as the Church’s attempt to discourage her
use of epilepsy medicine), insight into the Church’s mechanics
of brainwashing (“It is a slow train of mind control,” as she
put it), and descriptions of the Church’s theological tendencies delivered through pricey classes (“Keeping Scientology
Working is on every single course”). As she was winding down,
she described her harrowing escape (“[Scientology] chased me
across the country”) and highlighted the Church’s greatest
irony (“they are selling freedom but they enslave you”).
She also duly acknowledged Anonymous’s role: “Everyone
now has the luxury [of being public] because, (A) the Internet;
(B) critics even before Anonymous and; (C) Anonymous.
Right? Which was totally a game changer. Forever. And it
was and we all know this.” She highlighted the bravery of an
earlier generation of critics, a handful of whom were in attendance, who acted publicly when the number of defectors was
low and Scientology held the power to shatter their lives by
targeting critics aggressively and with impunity. “Anonymous
would not be around if it were not for the critics before them,”
she said.
Her next statement reverberated in slow motion through
the room and touched everyone personally: “There is no way
Scientology can win on us anymore. It is over.” For the exScientologists in the room, the words likely hit as a combination of relief and joy. The Anons, some whom had become
close to ex-Scientologists, likely felt the pride of political
accomplishment wash over them. There is nothing, nothing,
quite like the sweet taste of political victory, and Chanology 
had accomplished the unlikely: the group successfully challenged an organization that seemed all-powerful, impervious
to critique, and above the law.
More remarkable yet is that what started as a narrowly
configured politics launched against a single foe broke out of
that frame to encompass a fuller, diverse, thoroughly global
political enterprise—a bonfire that burned hot and bright
enough to spread across the globe, becoming Anonymous
Everywhere. Let’s now turn to the unlikely events that
propelled Anonymous’s surprising rise to prominence.

Weapons of the Geek
WikiLeaks: The Gift that Keeps on Giving
I
t was July 2010 and I was attending a conference called
Hackers on Planet Earth (also known as HOPE), held
every other year in New York City’s charmingly historic
(and, in its resemblance to the hotel in The Shining, creepily historical) Hotel Pennsylvania. Done with my talk, I was
ready to soak up the conference’s truly extraordinary, politically charged atmosphere of drama, intrigue, and suspense.
The charged mood at HOPE wasn’t the result of Anonymous.
At the time, while Anonymous could already be described as
politically quirky, the group was—geopolitically speaking—
of little real significance. Anonymous activists had started
to engage in other arenas (like Iran’s Green Revolution) but
were still primarily focused on Chanology, doggedly exposing Scientology’s human rights abuses and protesting every
month in cities across North America, Australia, Europe, and
a few other countries. A sizeable number of trolls still claimed
the Anonymous moniker, but this stream of ultracoordinated
motherfuckery was clearly on the wane.
No, the intrigue saturating the conference was due to another
player in town: the whistleblowing sensation WikiLeaks.
More specifically, interest coalesced around the recent trove 
82 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
of documents and footage leaked by a young army private
named Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and laid
at the feet of the world by WikiLeaks. Founded in 2006, the
driving concept behind WikiLeaks had been simple: provide
both a safe house and clearinghouse for leaks. It’d been at
it for years, circulating countless leaks but failing to draw
significant attention from established media institutions like
the New York Times. This lack of attention was not due to
unworthiness. In fact, some of these leaks—like the news that
the multinational company Trafigura had illegally dumped
toxic waste off the Ivory Coast—were both shocking and
shockingly absent from the mainstream news media. It also
wasn’t for want of trying—at least not exclusively. The British
government gagged the left-leaning newspaper the Guardian
from covering the Trafigura story. As the editors noted at the
time, “The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers
why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—
from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be
identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned,
on behalf of a client who must remain secret.”1
And so, by April 2010, WikiLeaks had dramatically switched
public relations strategies. When they released video footage
of a Baghdad air strike under the title “Collateral Murder,”
WikiLeaks left nothing to chance—packaging the already
shocking material in a way that delivered an extra punch.
They edited the video for maximum effect and added simple
but powerful editorial commentary at the beginning. Julian
Assange, the Australian hacker who founded WikiLeaks, was
then known in the media as an “international man of mystery.”
Now he broke with his previous disavowal of the spotlight. To
coincide with the publication of the video, he hosted a press
conference in Washington, DC, and followed it with a highprofile media tour.
The journalistic and public response was nothing short of
explosive. Media scholar Christian Christensen argues the
video is “one of the best known and most widely recognized 
results of the ongoing WikiLeaks project,” because it provides “visual evidence of the gross abuse of state and military
power.”2
 The black-and-white footage is captured from the
perspective of a soldier in an Apache attack helicopter as he
mows down civilians in a Baghdad suburb. The video, shot in
2007, provoked questions. Why had we not seen the footage
earlier? Two of the men killed in the attack were journalists
working for the Reuters news service and the organization
had been trying, in the years since the attack, to get its hands
on the footage via a Freedom of Information ACT request.
They suspected foul play, and their suspicions were not
unfounded. The video was an embarrassing reminder of how
the mainstream media had failed in its mission to inform the
public by turning its back on the direct and gruesome style
of war reportage it had practiced in the final years of the
Vietnam War.
More than anything, though, it was the pilots’ banal tone of
voice during their discussions with command about whether
to attack—they were calm to the point of psychosis—that
really sent waves of horror over you. One member of the crew
laughs upon discovering that one of the victims is a young girl.
“Well, it’s their fault for bringing their kids to a battle,” he
remarks nonchalantly.
As we all now know, Chelsea Manning chose to leak the
video, along with other vital documents, and a hacker named
Adrian Lamo ratted her out. On May 22, 2010, Manning confessed to Lamo during a chat conversation that she’d gifted
WikiLeaks the footage that was used to create “Collateral
Murder.” Early in the conversation, Lamo earned Manning’s
trust by misrepresenting himself:
I’m a journalist and a minister. You can pick either, and treat this as a
confession or an interview (never to be published) & enjoy a modicum
of legal protection.3
Weapons of the Geek 83
84 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Manning subsequently spilled her guts to a person she had
never met and whose claims of being a journalist and a priest
were tenuous as best.4
 Lamo turned the log over to both
the FBI and Wired magazine. The FBI arrested Manning,
ultimately leading to her admission that she had provided
WikiLeaks with not only the video footage seen in “Collateral
Murder,” but also the diplomatic cables WikiLeaks would
release over the next two years. Manning was sentenced by a
military judge to thirty-five years in prison, and is now at Fort
Leavenworth, following a year in solitary confinement before
being sentenced.5
At the 2010 HOPE conference, there was palpable tension
in the air. Rumors swirled that Julian Assange was going
to give the keynote. In a last-minute switch-up, it was not
Assange who stepped out on stage, but American hacker
Jacob Appelbaum. His riveting talk effectively outed him,
in front of everyone in attendance (including the inevitable
federal agents), as an affiliate of the embattled organization.
It was a bold move, given the tactics of silencing, prosecution, and intimidation leveled against the organization by
US authorities. His talk contextualized WikiLeaks historically into what is now commonly called “the fifth estate”: the
hackers, leakers, independent journalists, and bloggers who
serve the critical role that once fell to “the fourth estate,” the
mainstream media. Or as Appelbaum put it, “When the media
is gagged, we refuse to be gagged. We refuse to be silent”—
a declaration that was met with thunderous applause. (The
most glaring example of media silence in the past decade was
when the New York Times refused, at the request of the government, to publish a story on the NSA’s illegal, warrantless
wiretaps. The Times eventually ran the story—only because
the author, James Risen, was about to scoop the paper by publishing a book on the topic. The article which they tried so
hard to withhold ended up winning a Pulitzer Prize.)
While WikiLeaks, “Collateral Murder,” and Manning had
found pride of place in talks among politically minded hackers 
and transparency advocates, a fourth figure dominated most
conversations at HOPE: Lamo, the hacker traitor. He was on
the tip of every tongue for one simple reason: he was, like
them, a hacker himself—and present at the conference, no
less. People were completely pissed off. Appelbaum, during his
talk on WikiLeaks, promised not to utter a word about Lamo.
As he said this, he unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a T-shirt that
said “Stop Snitching.” The crowd went wild. Flyers bearing
Lamo’s face subsequently popped up throughout the venue.
Lamo was “WANTED// Dead or Alive// for bein’ a low-down
good for nuthin’ rat bastard.”
As I stood staring at the flyer, a hacker friend of mine darted
up from behind me to say hello. Shaking his head in Lamoevoked disgust, my friend explained that Assange was “the
real deal”—rare high praise from a fellow hacker. He had
known him back in the 1990s when the hacker underground
was in full force and roaming free, before the crackdowns
against them in the late 1990s. This class of hacker would routinely disregard the law in his or her explorations of private
networks and computer systems—not motivated by profit or
malice, but instead by an insatiable curiosity: a desire to know
how things worked. While the transgression itself offered a
form of pleasure, back then only a small class of hackers was
explicitly inclined toward activist-oriented politics. Julian
Assange was one of them. He was a thoroughly conscientious
hacker who even penned ethical manifestos explaining his
actions. Assange was part of a small team of “International
Subversives” who abided by a creed: “Don’t damage computer systems you break into (including crashing them); don’t
change the information in those systems (except for altering
logs to cover your tracks); and share information.”6
Wrapping up our discussion on Assange, my friend
and I heard some exciting news. HOPE’s main organizer,
Eric Corley—better known by his famous hacker handle
“Emmanuel Goldstein”—had announced an impromptu panel
on snitching and snitches, featuring none other than Lamo.
Weapons of the Geek 85
86 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Lamo was slated to sit alongside some of the most famous
underground phone phreaks and hackers of all time: Bernie S.,
Mark Abene (aka Phiber Optik), and Kevin Mitnick. A couple
had served jail time as the result of snitching. They themselves,
in their own trials and travails, had all refused to “cooperate,”
paying dearly with extended jail time for staying silent and
not ratting out their peers.
In all my years of attending hacker conferences, this panel
remains the most extraordinary I have witnessed. Imagine
2,600 hackers sitting before a single despised traitor as he
looks out at them from the stage and attempts to justify his
actions.
Hacker Town Hall on Snitching with the Most
Reviled Hacker Snitch of All Time
The hackers opened the panel by recounting riveting stories
of their exploits, eventual capture, and betrayal at the hands
of trusted peers. The first to speak was Goldstein, who
highlighted a truism I would see in action a little later with
Anonymous. When cops or Feds show up (usually at daybreak and knocking loudly while pointing guns), Goldstein
reminded the audience, “People panic … and the authorities
count on this. The authorities live for this kind of thing so that
they get as much information—they get all of us telling other
people about other people.”
When Lamo climbed on stage and ambled slowly toward
his chair, well … The circles under his eyes were deep brown,
and when he blinked it was done in slow motion and with
great difficulty, as if he had to force his eyelids down each
time. It wasn’t that he seemed nervous—he just seemed genuinely zonked; it is quite possible that he was, along with being
very tired, also medicated. Lamo had once been lauded as a
black hat hacker, and listening to him justify his actions was
spellbinding. He felt “compelled,” he explained, to hand over 
the logs in the interest of national defense. Bernie S., wanting
details, respectfully interrupted: “In what way did you feel
people were put at risk?” Lamo gave a rambling response:
“The State Department is involved in a number of intelligence
operations throughout the world, um, they are not supposed
to be, but they are looking out for the interests of Americans.”
This triggered immediate hisses from the crowd, and an audience member yelled, “The State Department activities put
other people at risk!”
Goldstein sensed the crowd might turn into a lynch mob,
sharpening their pitchforks and lighting their torches, ready
to run Lamo out of town. He calmed the audience down,
reminding them, “You will have your say”—but not before
Phiber Optik first chortled, “We will be handing out darts and
bows and arrows, so don’t worry.” The comic relief released
some steam, but the tense atmosphere simply returned until
the end. Time and again, Lamo’s attempts to rationalize his
actions were met with angry boos. After Lamo defended the
government and described his interactions with its agents as a
“surprisingly pleasant undertaking,” even Goldstein couldn’t
help himself; he interrupted Lamo before the Q and A period
to ask how he felt about the possibility that Manning might
spend the rest of her life in jail (someone in the crowd also
lobbed out “Torture!”). Without missing a beat, Lamo intonated slowly: “We don’t do that to our citizens.” Some of the
loudest hisses and boos of the day rustled through the audience, and someone yelled: “Guantanamo!” No matter what
Lamo said, it was apparent that he was digging himself into a
deeper hole—and it was also apparent that nearly the entire
auditorium was ready to fill in the dirt on top of him.
At the time, however engrossing the panel was, I could not
see its relevance to my project on Anonymous. WikiLeaks and
Anonymous were, back then, residing on different planets (even
if they were, admittedly, part of the same geeky galaxy by way
of their respective fights against censorship and Scientology).7
And yet, one year after the conference, on July 4, 2011, I
Weapons of the Geek 87
88 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
had my very first private IRC chat with Anonymous’s most
famous snitch: Hector Monsegur, who had previously been
known only as “Sabu.” By then he had already been arrested
and was secretly working with the FBI—though this fact was
lost both on myself and many others at time (in spite of a
litany of now obvious clues). Monsegur’s charisma—and his
adeptness in psychological warfare tactics, like displacing suspicion by accusing others of snitching—blinded many to the
hints he dropped in plain text a few months after his covert
arrest: “Stick to yourselves,” he wrote on reddit. “If you are in
a crew—keep your opsec up 24/7. Friends will try to take you
down if they have to.”8
 This echoed a lesson which Manning
had learned first hand a year earlier.
But the mutual problem of snitches is the most tenuous of the
emergent connections between WikiLeaks and Anonymous.
We can trace a more direct coupling by looking at the trajectory of AnonOps.
DDoSing on Random Dice Day
AnonOps emerged in 2010, just a few months after HOPE
ended. It began as a new Anonymous node and eventually
grew into a full-blown IRC network. The network would
take the world by storm thanks to its experiments—and I do
mean, quite literally, experiments, as the group never carefully
thought through anything until much later—with a slew of
direct action political tactics. Many of these were straight up
illegal, so it was only a matter of time before they drew the
attention of the FBI.
Although the history of AnonOps would come to intersect with WikiLeaks in December 2010, these two entities
could not be more different when judged from the perspective of organizational mechanics. WikiLeaks was built up
as a carefully sculpted life’s work. Assange, as founder and
spokesperson, controlled—too tightly, many would come to 
say—most aspects, and his personality and identity became
hopelessly intertwined with the WikiLeaks name. When his
personal reputation was sullied, it tarnished the organization
as a whole. On the other hand, the constitution of AnonOps
was a happenstance affair, like Project Chanology before it:
born in the contingent convergence of timing, and media attention, each element contributed to its meteoritic rise and rapid
success—a reminder again of how tricksters, like Anonymous,
are perfectly poised to exploit the accidents gifted to them and
sometimes benefit from acting on a whim.
It was late August 2010, about two and a half years after
hackers had first adopted the name Anonymous to venture
into activism. By this time, Chanology had organized street
protests, forged tight alliances and friendships with ex-Scientologists, dabbled in Iran’s unsuccessful Green Revolution, and
branched out into other areas of Internet activism. In February
2010, after Australia’s Telecommunication Minister proposed
regulation to filter Internet pornography, some Anons rolled
out “Operation Titstorm” and successfully overwhelmed government servers with a barrage of traffic requests. This op,
proclaimed as part of the Operation Freedom Movement, was
a harbinger of what was soon to come.
A number of Anons relaunched the Operation Freedom
Movement, rebranded the Internet Freedom Movement
(IFM)—on July 5, eleven days before HOPE.9
 Those involved
in the IFM, along with the geek world at large, had set their
sights on protesting the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
(ACTA). ACTA sought, among other things, to introduce
sweeping regulations which would criminalize copyright
infringement and encourage Internet service providers to
profile, track, and monitor their users. Opposition was fierce,
and nearly every group involved in the politics of access—
Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation,
Public Knowledge, La Quadrature du Net—criticized the
secrecy under which the treaty was being negotiated, and
categorically opposed its ratification.
Weapons of the Geek 89
90 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
The proposed methodology of the IFM was to lobby politicians and raise public awareness using propaganda materials
and websites. As part of these efforts, advocates created a dedicated chat room called “#antiactaplanning” on the IRC server
OccultusTerra. In late August 2010, an Anon activist going
by the nickname “golum” (not his usual pseudonym) entered
the chat room and boldly declared his intent to move things
forward by DDoSing the Office of the US Trade Representative
(USTR) website, ustr.gov, at 9 pm EST on September 19, 2010.
The USTR’s office was a natural choice given that ACTA was
a US-led trade agreement and the USTR had the muscle to
levy sanctions against nations that violated trade treaties.
But many people in the chat room had concerns: First,
Chanology had already set a political precedent by disavowing the use of illegal tactics like DDoS. And second, no one
could understand why that particular date had been chosen. It
struck many as completely arbitrary, and it (mostly) was; the
one connection was that September 19 is Talk Like a Pirate
Day. golum faced vehement opposition, at least from those
who were paying attention to their screens (all pseudonyms
have been changed):
<matty>: why before it is signed?
<golum>: Because it’s a Sunday and everyone likes Sundays
<matty>: again … why before it is signed?
<golum>: And because I threw a dice
<golum>: And it said 19th
[…]
<golum>: My prediction is by September 19th people will become
more aware.
<golum>: Trust me on this. September 19th.
<fatalbert>: trust me on a random dice day
Although everyone on the channel savaged golum’s proposal,
he remained unmoved:
<golum>: Whatever, listen. I’ve heard all the arguments for NOT
ddosing. But the truth is we need to wake them up.
[…]
<golum>: I understand that ddosing could potentially harm our cause.
<golum>: But I think the risk is worth it.
<fatalbert>: well i as for myself disagree therefore im not helping with
ddos
<golum>: We need attention
<+void>: OMG ITS THE ANONYMOUS, THE ONLY THING THEY
DO IS DDOS, OMGOMGOMOGMOMG LETS MAKE ACTA PASS
ON POSITIVE
<golum>: No.
<golum>: matty—how did contacting the politicians go?
<BamBam>: Yeah I’ve always kinda hated ddos
<golum>: Look. i’ve heard the arguments I just wanted to say, we
should do this.
<golum>: We are NOT ddosing now. This will be in 20 days.
<golum>: 20 days is a lot of time.
A few Anons, conveying the legal risks, highlighted the difference between targeting the US government and targeting other
entities, and then considered the conversation over. (Note also
that the risk assessment about arrests was accurate—over
twenty-seven individuals have been since indicted for the
ensuing spate of DDoS actions—and in the United States you
can still get in deep trouble for targeting anyone famous):
<matty>: this is not justin beiber, this is the us govt ffs
[…]
<golum>: Everyone please, listen to me, when I speak
<AnonLaw>: I’ll be laughing as you go to jail
<matty>: i am not here for the fuckin lulz
[…]
<golum>: It’s official. Start preparing.
Weapons of the Geek 91
92 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
If you are wondering about just what “official” means in
Anonymous: well, yes, something can be deemed “official” if
someone declares it as such and, crucially, if enough people
also support it. But at the time, support for militant direct
action tactics on this IRC channel were lacking. Although
someone had initiated an IRC channel called “#ddos” with
the mandate of discussing the possible use of the tactic, the
freewheeling aspect of Anonymous IRC chat only goes so far
before bumping up against norms and rules:
<Lola>: What happened to #DDoS?
<Fred>: Take that to off topic please.
<Fred>: This is strictly for ACTA planing.
<Fred>: Not for a chit chat
<Lola>: #ddos was an ACTA planning channel.
<Lola>: I want to know what happened to it
<Fred>: Questions about #ddos is off topic.
<Fred>: This is for planing.
<Yagermister>: #DDoS is BAD
The next day Lola appeared again—this time to discuss
botnets (networks of remotely controlled computers which
can be used to strengthen a DDoS assault):
<Lola>: do you have a botnet?
<Lola>: without one you can’t do much
<Lola>: you can get like $10 for 100 these days
<Lola>: from some skiddie forums
Lola is told, again, to stop “discussing illegal activities.”
This is, perhaps, an opportune moment to discuss botnets
in more detail—especially since they became increasingly
important to the Anonymous DDoS operations we will consider a little later. There is a Wild West cattle rustling aspect
to the whole affair. A botnet is essentially just a collection of
computers connected to the Internet, allowing a single entity 
extra processing power or network connections toward the
performance of various tasks including (but not limited to)
DDoSing and spam bombing. A botnet is a very powerful tool,
involving (as it does) computers that are connected across
various parts of the world and capable of distributing tasks.
Participants whose computers are tapped for membership in a
botnet usually have no idea that their computer is being used
for these purposes. Have you ever wondered why your computer worked so slowly, or strangely? Well, you might have
unwittingly participated in a DDoS.
A computer most often becomes a member of a botnet
by getting infected by malware. This can happen through a
number of different methods—that hilarious cat video you
downloaded, the malicious link in an email from your aunt, a
phishing attack you didn’t even know about, or a virus piggybacking on some software you downloaded from the Internet.
Once infected, the computer runs a small program, usually
hidden in the process table so it is not easily found, which
mediates its involvement in the botnet.
Although there are many different ways for a botnet to
work, one classic method involves connecting it to a preconfigured IRC server and channel. Once this connection is
made, the computer will wait patiently—unbeknownst to their
owners—awaiting orders from the botnet herder (yeehaw!).
The herder is the individual capable of directing the computers that make up the botnet. Typically, this is the person who
infected the computers in the first place. Usually he or she is
waiting in the designated IRC channel, grinning from ear-toear as more and more infected computers join the channel,
like zombies awaiting orders. This is known as the commandand-control channel (C&C). A typical scenario might see a
herder tabbing back and forth between regular chat channels
and the hidden C&C channel as it grows more powerful by
the moment.
A typical botnet might boast around twenty thousand
computers, but larger botnets have been tracked to upwards
Weapons of the Geek 93
94 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
of thirty million. (Though most botnets have a bad rap—
and for good reason—some botnets are voluntary and
participatory. The most famous of these is probably SETI@
home, the three-million-strong string of computers searching for alien life in outer space.) They hover on this C&C
channel until the botnet herder gives them an order—usually
authenticated—to perform some task. So for example, the
botnet herder might simply say, “ddos 172.16.44.1,” and
then all the connected bots will begin to attack that specified
IP address.10
Another common task for botnets is to send mass amounts
of unwanted email. Spam is often stopped by an algorithm
which determines its unwanted nature and blocks the sending
address—but when tens of thousands of different machines
with different addresses are sending the spam, it is much
harder to track down and stop. Often botnet herders assemble
their network not for their own purposes, but in order to sell
the services of their bots to a spammer.
To be able to control tens of thousands of computers from a
central location is a powerful feeling. By simply issuing commands you can make thousands of computers do something
for you, and the larger the number of computers participating,
the more powerful those commands are. In the botnet world
there is an ongoing struggle over who has the most bots, the
most bandwidth, and the best-infected machines (university,
corporate, and government computers tend to be on better
bandwidth).
This competition is so fierce that botnet herders will often
try to take over other botnets. On the other side of the fence,
law enforcement agencies and individual organizations that
are fighting spam also struggle to take over botnets in order
to neutralize them. This is not a trivial thing to do. One has
to first identify the C&C. If you can figure out where the bots
get their commands from, you can join the IRC channel, masquerading as a compromised machine, and wait to receive a
command from the botnet herder. If the botnet herder sends 
an authentication alongside the command, you may have the
password necessary to issue commands to the entire botnet
yourself.11
But, as Lola indicated, you can also access all that fun
and power for a cheap “subscription fee.” People on the IRC
server were not happy with all this talk of the underworld of
botnets and DDoS. The IRC operators booted the pro-DDoS
contingent from the server. They left undeterred, becoming
Anonymous nomads.
It is perhaps ironic that golum, as one participant explained
it to me, “was a central figure in the IFM movement, if not
THE central figure.” golum may have spearheaded the initiative, but his influence waned as he clamored for the types of
digital tactics firmly rejected by the majority of Anons driving
Chanology. Effectively, this majority managed “to change
the direction of the operation” so as to keep it entirely legal.
Those wanting to use direct action techniques found themselves increasingly marginalized. But while golum’s random
dice day vision may have seemed to them nothing more than,
well, random, golum was actually an adept organizer with a
keen feel for media dynamics. I had seen in him action many
times, and he was one of the finest propagandists and organizers in all of Anonymous. golum left the IFM to form a new
direct action–oriented wing, taking some Anons with him.
One participant in the new militant enterprise, which would
come to be known as AnonOps, described golum as having
“a very, very good antenna for PR and propaganda, and
he realized the (at the time) immense psychological impact
of declaring that a website would vanish, and then taking
it down.”
golum took his tactics, and his supporters, elsewhere.
Strangely, given his announcement of random dice day, he had
in fact erected a website with an ACTA protest timeline that
differed from the one he had announced on the IRC channel.
The site designated the crescendo of activities for November
5, the worldwide day of protests known as Guy Fawkes Day.
Weapons of the Geek 95
96 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
golum had conceived of different groups divided by chat
rooms (#bump, #newor, #op), each with distinct roles and
responsibilities.
Confusion loomed large over the DDoS campaign’s
start date—but in the end, thanks to the initiative of some
unknown actors, it was, as golum predicted, to fall in the
middle of September. A stunning and spectacular avalanche
of DDoS attacks attracted over seven hundred individuals into the splinter group’s chatroom and continued for
over two months. In the end, they did not target the Office
of the US Trade Representative. Instead, in a defense of file
sharing, they DDoSed the heck out of a number of procopyright associations, such as the Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association
of America (RIAA). The media attention was significant and
the new crew was hooked. Displaying the Pirate Bay’s ship
logo—also adopted by Anons as their campaign symbol—the
BBC reported: “Piracy activists have carried out coordinated
attacks on websites owned by the music and film industry.”12
Anonymous listed every news story written about “Operation
Payback”—as the group called it—on tieve.tk, which also
became the go-to hub for information as Anonymous migrated
from IRC server to IRC server before establishing one of its
own in late October.
Drawing upon my experiences with Anonymous, I can
confidently declare that had golum’s breakaway group
simply rallied troops around a slogan like “ACTA sucks,” the
unprecedented waves of support would never have materialized. Fortunately, the spirit of Puck delivered a delightful
accident to this nascent Anonymous crew. It was as if the
trickster of crossroads, Eshu, then appeared, urging them to
make a decision. And, as we will see, their choice allowed
the pod to sprout into one of the Internet’s biggest political
sensations.
“At times, we have to go an extra mile and attack the site”
The game-changing piece of information first appeared in a
technical news article published by an Indian media outlet on
September 5, 2010. It took a full week for Western journalists to pick up the story, at which point it circulated along
the boutique technical press. The story quotes the managing
director of Aiplex, an Indian software firm purportedly hired
by corporations to DDoS file sharing sites like the Pirate Bay:
The problem is with torrent sites, which usually do not
oblige [when served with a written legal request to take
down a movie]. In such cases, we flood the website with lots
of requests, which results in database error, causing denial
of service as each server has a fixed bandwidth capacity. At
times, we have to go an extra mile and attack the site and
destroy the data to stop the movie from circulating further.13
Ironically, given the target, that admission essentially provided evidence of a contemporary practice analogous to the
privateering of yesteryear. Until outlawed in 1856, European
powers routinely hired pirates to operate as their agents on
the high seas—with the added advantage of being able to
obscure their own involvement in whatever unsavory business they might require the pirates to perform. This was not
the first time evidence surfaced that the copyright industries
hired technologists to do their (illegal) dirty work. In 2005,
the MPAA employed a hacker to break into the servers of
TorrentSpy, a search engine for file sharing material, and
search for confidential information they hoped would provide
evidence of law breaking. During an exclusive interview with
Wired.com, this hacker explained how the MPAA attempted
to lure him with cash and other luxury goods: “We would
need somebody like you. We would give you a nice paying job,
a house, a car, anything you needed … if you save Hollywood
for us you can become rich and powerful.”14
Weapons of the Geek 97
98 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
But with Aiplex, it was the first time the admission was so
frank and forthcoming.
The reaction from Anonymous and many other geeky quarters of the Internet was predictably swift and biting. For well
over a decade, the copyright industry/lobby/trade associations
poured millions of dollars into aggressively hunting down,
and suing, file-sharers and hackers who ran peer-to-peer sites,
like the Pirate Bay, which coordinate access to troves of copyrighted material. Now segments of the copyright industry
were going the “extra mile” by hiring hackers to engage in
illegal tactics of their own to curb illegal file sharing.
Geeks criticized Aiplex’s technical methods (it is common
for geeks to take any and all opportunity to debate the merits
of any piece of technology). They made fun of Aiplex’s terrible and asinine criminal-confession-as-PR strategy. And on
TorrentFreak, a popular website dedicated to reporting news
on file sharing, one commentator noted: “AiPlex is just asking
… strike that I meant; _begging_ for trouble.”15
The writer was spot on. Revenge arrived in the form of—did
you guess it?—a DDoS campaign. Someone took the initiative
to take down Aiplex, almost certainly using a botnet. golum
and the other Anons who had set their sights on protesting
ACTA through the use of DDoS campaigns exploited this
opportunity to shift their energies and attention toward this
event. It is perhaps no wonder that golum and his followers
had no qualms about ditching ACTA, switching targets, and
finding a new start date thanks to another bit of opportunistic
chance—just like that initial rolling of the dice.
In one of the first propaganda posters for Operation Payback,
this new Anonymous cell admitted that the DDoS campaign
was “ahead of schedule,” thanks to an unexpected strike made
by a single individual. The activists then predicted, “This will
be a calm, coordinated display of blood. We will not be merciful.” Anonymous boldly signed off: “GOOD HUNTING.”
So was the “hunting,” as the poster claimed, a calm, coordinated, tactical incision in which Anonymous would show 
no mercy? Sort of. But, as we will see in a moment, the first
few weeks of the campaign were rather chaotic—partially
because the influx of supporters was hefty, at least for standards of the time. With so many people, proceeding in a calm
and coordinated fashion was difficult. The first campaign
launched September 17, 2010, targeting the MPAA’s website
and taking it offline for roughly eighteen hours.16 Over the
next four days Anonymous hit, among other targets, the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, Aiplex
(naturally), the RIAA, and ACS:Law, a law firm in the UK
that worked on behalf of the copyright industry. From the
perspective of these renegade Anons, Operation Payback was
a resounding, glorious success, and the media were squeezed
for many articles.
One of the remarkable feats of Operation Payback was how
AnonOps managed, using propaganda material alone, to convince both the media (and many of their own members!) that
the MPAA had hired Aiplex; there is no evidence to support this
claim. Instead it is now widely believed that Aiplex had been
hired by the Bollywood movie industry. And yet on September
20, 2010, scores of reputable news outfits, including Reuters,
published statements in the following vein, despite flimsy—
nonexistent, really—evidence: “MPAA.org and the Web site
of Aiplex Software, a company the MPAA hired to target sites
where piracy was rampant, were incapacitated for much of
the day, according to the piracy blog TorrentFreak.”17 Because
it was covered extensively in the media, I myself repeated this
fib on countless occasions. To this day I still cannot ascertain
who first proposed it, and whether it was borne from honest
confusion (so many of the core participants truly believed it)
or conniving duplicity. Whatever the case, Anonymous would
seize upon this new-found specialty in the art of duping the
media.
After a few days of the operation, AnonOps found itself
on the verge of its most successful attacks of the season—
where it would, in fact, show no mercy. The targeted
Weapons of the Geek 99
100 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
organization, ACS:Law, would be shamed into oblivion thanks
to Anonymous’s first major leak.
“I have far more concern over the fact of my
train turning up ten minutes late … than them
wasting my time with this sort of rubbish”
For the ragtag team assembled under the auspices of
Operation Payback, the MPAA became the obvious target of
preference. But by September 21, Anonymous could no longer
effectively take down the organization’s site—the MPAA
had implemented sturdy DDoS protection by employing an
outside firm. And so, on September 21, 2010, following vigorous internal debate, Anonymous set its sights on ACS:Law, a
British law firm notorious for sending threatening letters at
the behest of copyright owners to thousands of alleged filesharers, demanding money and the cessation of ostensibly
illegal downloading. It took Anonymous much more time to
choose ACS:Law as its target (two hours) than it did to take
down the law firm’s website (two minutes). After the hit, the
firm’s head solicitor, Andrew Crossley, was so unimpressed by
the attack that he hastily volleyed back with the following
statement: “It was only down for a few hours. I have far more
concern over the fact of my train turning up ten minutes late
or having to queue for a coffee than them wasting my time
with this sort of rubbish.”18
But, it turned out, these few hours of website downtime
might have cost him his firm. ACS:Law’s web team was so
incompetent that in restoring the site they accidentally made
an entire backup, replete with emails and passwords, available for anyone with a modicum of technical ability to see and
take. Anonymous noticed it, snatched it, and promptly threw
all the emails on the Pirate Bay. It was the first in a string
of stunning, Anonymous-led leaks that provided evidence of
grave corporate misconduct. 
By this time, Crossley’s firm was already under government scrutiny. Months earlier, technology journalist Nate
Anderson reported on what he described as a “spirited debate”
among members of the House of Lords. As they discussed an
amendment called “Remedy for groundless threats of copyright infringement proceedings,” many lords were critical of
ACS:Law’s methods.19 Lord Lucas, who had proposed the
amendment, offered particularly harsh words to ACS:Law:
“We must also do something about the quantum of damages
that is being sought. In a civil procedure on a technical matter,
it amounts to blackmail; the cost of defending one of these
things is reckoned to be £210,000.”20
The emails obtained by Anonymous simply helped confirm,
with a far more granular and damning level of detail, the firm’s
relentless targeting of alleged copyright violators on behalf of
copyright associations.21 One tactic involved writing married
men with allegations that they had downloaded gay porn;
many of these men paid five hundred to six hundred pounds
to make ACS:Law go away.22 The leaked emails were a final
decisive blow, and by February 2011, ACS:Law had closed
down.23
It bears noting, again, that AnonOps’ decision to target
ACS:Law was, like many of its decisions, made in the heat
of the (chaotic) moment. Had the group voted otherwise, the
operation would have never transpired. It’s worth looking into
just how these voting mechanisms work, and the targeting of
ACS:Law provides a prime example.
The public channel #savetpb (i.e., Save the Pirate Bay—later
to become #operationpayback) hosted, at its peak, over one
thousand participants. Many of them had come from 4chan,
where news about Aiplex’s methods spread and roiled many
into action. Those on the public channels were encouraged
to use a tool called the “Low Orbit Ion Cannon” (LOIC for
short), subtitled “When harpoons, air strikes, and nukes fail.”
LOIC is an open-source application that allows users to individually contribute to a DDoS campaign from the comfort of
Weapons of the Geek 101
102 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
their home by simply entering the target address and clicking the temptingly giant button marked “IMMA CHARGIN
MAH LAZER.” By entering an IP address identified within a
channel users could direct their computers to join a chorus of
protesters in sending requests to a target. Alternatively, participants could set LOIC to “hive mode,” which allows computers
to automatically contribute to the voluntary botnet.
Meanwhile, in the private channel first named #savetpbmods and soon after renamed #command, others were
engaged in deep, often heated, and utterly confusing debate
regarding strategy and targets. Most in the public channel
were unaware of the existence of this private channel, unless
they were one of the few eventually tapped to join. During an
interview, one of the founders of the secret channel explained
the selection criteria as follows: “You’re invited by another
member of #command if you’ve proved yourself productive/
useful or trustworthy.”
Presented below are only a tiny number of excerpts from a
truly convoluted—yet still semi-coherent—two-hour conversation that occurred in #command as participants decided to
target ACS:Law. Decision-making often follows a liquid path.
It opened with the participants noting the impressive number
of individuals gathered on the public channel—awaiting, as it
were, their orders:
<Anon2>: 660+ people
<Anon5>: eh oh
<Anon5>: the fan is hitting the shit
<Anon6>: yeah

<Anon4>: the fan blew up from shit
<Anon7>: their [MPAA’s] ddos protection is working
<Anon7>: i suggest we migrate targets?
<Anon7>: bpi? [British Phonographic Industry]
<Anon8>: why not riaa? [Recording Industry Association of America]
<Anon7>: because we failed with bpi last time due to small numbers
As they conversed, numbers continued to climb, and they
started to worry about momentum and morale:
<Anon1>: in the meanwhile, there are a number of news articles
popping up saying we did at least a lot of damage
<Anon8>: what has BPI done?
<Anon7>: Well
<Anon9>: Guys, do not discuss any drama in the main chat.
<Anon9>: We are here for propaganda. Lifting spirits.
[…]
<Anon9>: If we even INDICATE our efforts are “useless,” people will
leave en-masse.
<Anon9>: It has always been about morale.
<Anon9>: We don’t have like 800 people because we tell the truth.
<Anon9>: we have 800 people that BELIEVE they are doing something.
<Anon7>: Guys, I do NOT want us to fail in the eyes of the public or
make our troops go to waste. We need to migrate targets, soon
Disagreement over targets grew, and someone pointed out
that the financial hit against MPAA was negligible since
the organization paid a lump sum for its DDoS protection.
Eventually, people agreed to stop hammering the MPAA and
shift targets. Someone highlighted the nature of this endeavor:
“but consider it an experiment either way. Prove me wrong.”
Just when participants thought they reached a consensus,
someone yelped and insisted on a vote; as is often the case
with any IRC-based meeting (only magnified with a group like
Anonymous), conversation became even more tangled:
<Anon7>: Nooo
<Anon7>: Wait
<Anon7>: Let’s vote.
<Anon8>: We have public opinion now because we do not target
random sites
<Anon7>: First, let’s nominate sites.
<Anon7>: So far riaa and bpi has been nominated.

<Anon9>: I think I agree with Anon13 here. ACS:Law.

<Anon1>: well, /b/ a new poster with tomorrow’s target, same time?
<Anon10>: I’m in for acs:law too
<Anon4>: me too
<Anon13>: Shall we change the topic in the main chat and divert the
lazers now, so losing almost nobody, or attack tomorrow, potentially
losing hundreds?
<Anon8>: someone give me an equally good motivation for a target
[…]
<Anon7>: let’s vote?
<Anon13>: I vote for ACS.
<Anon7>: DDoS ACS:LAW. 1 = yes, 2 = no
As some voted, others continued to broadly debate the choice
of targets, arguing, “Attacking anti-piracy agencies at random
isn’t helping our cause.” This prompted another long, tedious
round of voting. Finally, two hours later, they seemed to have
inched closer to an agreement, but in the middle of debating,
guess what happened?

<Anon13>: That was quick.
<Anon1>: how long did it take us to vote again? XD
<Anon14>: Longer then it took for it to go down
Someone must have felt that there was enough of a consensus
to move forward and fired up the botnets.
Two hours of planning, two minutes of DDoS’ing, and not
long after the firm closed. A little over a year after Anonymous’s
email leak, Crossley—who had been more worried about
queuing for a coffee—was tried in the Solicitors Disciplinary
Tribunal for an array of charges. He conceded to six of the
seven allegations, including the following two: “acting in a
way that was likely to diminish the trust the public places
in him or in the legal profession” and “using his position as
a solicitor to take unfair advantage of the recipients of the
letters for his own benefit.”24 He was ordered to pay £76,000
in fines and had his license suspended for two years. Even
though he challenged the claim that he had not taken proper
measures to protect client data, he was found guilty as charged
and the Information Commissioner’s Office also fined him for
the data breach.25
Although many of Anonymous’s actions seek simply to
attract media attention for the sake of airing an issue, sometimes fate gave them more than they bargain for—like an
incidental opportunity to curb corruption.
Weapons of the Geek (Rarely Agree)
By the end of fall 2010, with the constant deployment of digital
direct action techniques, AnonOps had breathed new life into
the still nascent idea that Anonymous could be a banner for
activism; the name, once exclusively tied to the most abject
forms of trolling, was slowly, but steadily, becoming associated with an irreverent brand of dissent. Regardless, those
behind the September and October campaigns, like golum and
Weapons of the Geek 105
106 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
the numbered Anons above, did not expect to exist as a team,
much less as a network, for more than a few weeks. But, in a
mirroring of the events that aggregated Chanology into a discrete entity, media validation helped solidify this new team as
well. In a rare interview with TorrentFreak, one core organizer
explained why:
The operation’s command was “pleasantly” surprised by the
overwhelming media coverage and attention, but wondered
where to go from there. They became the center of attention
but really had no plan going forward. Eventually they decided
to continue down the road that brought them there in the
first place—more DDoS attacks … The media attention was
indeed part of what fuelled the operation to go forward.26
With AnonOps here to stay, there were also clear signs of a
cleavage emerging between different nodes within the activist
branches of Anonymous. Chanology and AnonOps, the two
most active wings, could not be more different in terms of
tactics. One usually stayed within the bounds of the law and
the other avidly, and enthusiastically, experimented with law
breaking. By way of acknowledging these internal feuds and
sectarian impulses, Anonymous would eventually adopt the
refrain “Anonymous is not unanimous.”27
It was around this time that I started to grasp the overarching significance of these disparate and divergent geeks and
hackers—Anonymous (Chanology vs. AnonOps), Assange,
Manning, the Pirate Bay, and others—all entering the political arena and in much greater numbers than ever before. In
orchestrating protests across a range of issues—in particular
civil liberties—they transformed policy, law, media representations, and public opinion. While certainly unique in its
bombast and capriciousness, Anonymous was clearly part of
a wellspring of hackers and geeks who were taking political
matters into their own hands and making their voices heard.
Anonymous signaled the growing importance of what I call 
“weapons of the geek,” in contrast to “weapons of the weak,”
a term anthropologist James Scott used in his 1985 book of the
same name to capture the unique clandestine nature of peasant
politics. While Weapons of the Weak describes the tactics of
economically marginalized populations who engage in smallscale illicit acts—such as foot dragging and vandalism—that
don’t appear on their surface to be political, weapons of the
geek is a modality of politics exercised by a class of privileged
and visible actors who often lie at the center of economic life.
Technology does not simplistically determine the politics of
hacking, even if technological experiences usually inform its
expression. Just as there are many ways to hack, there are
many ways for hackers to enter the political arena. From
policy making to engagements with Pirate Parties, from reinventing the law through free software to performing risky acts
of civil disobedience, the geek and hacker are not bound to
a single political sentiment, such as libertarianism, and they
certainly don’t agree on how social change should proceed.
What they all have in common is that their political tools,
and to a lesser degree their political sensibilities, emerge from
the concrete experiences of their craft, like administering a
server or editing videos. Often, these skills are channeled into
activities in order to bolster civil liberties, such as privacy.
Unlike peasants who seek to remain inconspicuous and
anonymous even as a group, geeks and hackers—even the
anonymous Anonymous—explicitly call attention to themselves via their volatile, usually controversial, political acts.
By fall 2010, AnonOps was at the forefront of the tests and
experiments that sought to probe the new possibilities and
legal limitations of digital civil disobedience.
And while some would count these experiments as a success,
others—even those aligned on the same side of the struggle for
civil liberties—were wary of the tactics employed. The Pirate
Party in particular was less than enthused about the political use of DDoS. The Pirate Party is a political party which
has made inroads in both Europe and Australia (and claims a
Weapons of the Geek 107
108 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
very weak base in North America). Swedish free-culture advocate Rickard Falkvinge first chartered it in 2006, and now its
platform is built on copyright reform, demands for Internet
freedoms and civil liberties, and the building of tools to
support direct democracy. The Pirate Parties in the UK and US
wrote a letter to AnonOps requesting an immediate cessation
of DDoS activity. (It should be noted that the letter prompted
not only a vigorous debate among AnonOps participants—
but also among Pirate Party members themselves):28
Operation: Payback needs to end. While it is certainly an
indication that an increasing number of people are becoming
frustrated with the way laws are being constantly re-written
to kill our creative culture in the name of preserving profitability, its methods do more harm than good to the global
effort.
By continuing Operation: Payback attacks, you will
hamper those who promote copyright reform and curtailment of abuses of copyright, but who do so within the
bounds of the law. Instead of being able to argue for legislative reform of copyright on its own merits, they will be
accused of defending criminals and promoting lawlessness.
It will be easier for legislators and the media to ignore the
clear benefits of fair copyrights and free speech, in favor of
clamoring for harsher legislation to “stop those pirates and
hackers.”29
Perhaps surprisingly, those Operation Payback participants
sitting in #command, for a very brief period of time, took
the Pirate Party’s call to heart and considered aborting the
use of illegal tactics in favor of a more moderate, reformist style: the advancing of a list of demands. The Torrent
Freak interview revealed, publicly, the existence of the secret
#command channel, and affirmed participants’ new embrace
of law-abiding tactics. Below are some key excerpts from the
interview:
The core group is the #command channel on IRC. This core
group does nothing more than being some sort of intermediary between the people in that IRC channel and the actual
attack. Another group of people on IRC (the main channel
called #operationpayback) are just there to fire on targets …
Last week command decided to slow the DDoS attacks
down and choose another strategy, mainly to regain the
focus of attention. It was decided that they would make
a list of demands for governments worldwide. In a move
opposed to the desires of the anarchic influences, command
decided to get involved in the political discussion.30
This dual news—that there was a secret channel, and that its
members wanted to go “legit”—was received extremely poorly
by the public-facing channel #operationpayback on AnonOps.
The result was, in essence, a mutiny. “Gobo” (not his real
pseudonym), one core participant active on the public channel—
who would later become a member of another separate,
secretive channel recatalyzed by the revelation—explained:
That article seriously pissed a lot of people in the main
channel off. A huge amount of arguing broke out over
Anonymous being leaderless and “who the fuck do they
think they are.” Somehow #command didn’t really perceive
how much controversy they were generating by overstepping the limits of their purpose (as defined by the main
chan’s participant).31
Little did the Anons crying foul know there was also another,
even more secretive channel by the name #internetfeds.
Originally chartered for the purposes of executing ops—
especially covert hacking—it had gone idle for a period. One
of its members reached out to Gobo and invited him to join
#internetfeds with a scheme to revive it; the public commitment to a cessation of DDoSing suddenly looked very dubious
indeed:
Weapons of the Geek 109
110 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Essentially the ethos was as follows: Operation Payback
would publicly “stop all illegal activity” as per the letter to
the pirate party. #internetfeds would carry on these activities privately and in the name of “Anonymous” but *not*
in the name of Operation Payback, and its existence was
to be kept sacredly secret so as not to jeopardize the new
“legitimate protest” image #command wanted to cultivate
for Operation Payback.32
So, a small crew in a small cabal was planning to rekindle
another, even smaller, and more secretive cabal—committed
only loosely to the guiding principle of, like Fight Club,
keeping mum about its existence (the group may have operated in secret, but each of its defacements came with a logo
that included its name: “Pwned by #internetfeds”).33 As it
turned out, #internetfeds never had to carry out this proposed
“sacredly secret” mission because participants in the main
channel essentially told #command to bugger off—affirming
their intention to continue to DDoS with or without them:
“civil war” broke out on the public channel where, according
to Gobo, most people
roundly condemned not just the idea of going legit, but
specifically the fact that #command had so massively leaderfagged by agreeing to all this without even mentioning it to
the main channel. There was an extremely bitter argument
and following that, someone simply told people to forget
about the #loic hive and hit the next target manually, with
or without the support of #command.34
Those in #command listened to the angry IRC masses and
“almost immediately backpedaled on the pledge to make
the op go legitimate,” explained Gobo. Although #internetfeds was no longer technically needed for this particular
DDoS (since #command was put back on the DDoSing track
thanks to pressure exerted by those on the public channel), 
it persisted anyway, ultimately becoming “an extremely militant defacement and leaking channel,” as Gobo described it,
which would really shine in the coming months. Peace had
been restored, but barely.
Legitimacy vs. Legality
In September 2010, when a new Anonymous node arose out
of the righteous anger borne from the double dealing of the
copyright industry, it seemed always on the brink of disorder. Action was often heated, messy, soulful, and spontaneous,
compounding the thrills experienced by all. Increasingly,
AnonOps, had become more deliberate in its decision-making
process—the direct result of collective thinking on the subject
of collectivity itself. Undoubtedly, the topic of organization
was highlighted by many participants upset at the double
standards in operation during the initial campaigns. One of the
core hackers explained to me why he felt justified in forging
forward with these illegal tactics, a sentiment that seemed to
capture the collective mood of the time: “I saw it as a form of
poetic justice in response to Aiplex DDoSing the Pirate Bay.”
Gobo who had worked closely with golum highlighted how
he always
spoke very passionately about the fact that people he’d
known from Anonymous [had been arrested for taking part
in trolling-based DDoS attacks] and yet here were major
corporate people boasting about it and everyone knew 100
percent that no one would ever prosecute them. golum has
a very strong ideological belief in the idea that there should
be no double standards in politics, and so for him it was the
“corporations getting away with crimes” ordinary people
don’t get away with.35
Weapons of the Geek 111
112 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
By November, individual sentiments such as these were
transformed into a collective political statement. Soon after
AnonOps retracted its commitment to going legit, the group
published a letter to the Pirate Party. It included a sophisticated justification for DDoS that focused on legitimacy over
legality. Here is an excerpt:
Anonymous and Operation Payback share values and goals—
i.e. freedom of information, expression, and sharing—with
the Pirate Parties, but we are absolutely independent entities.
We are not concerned with legality, but with legitimacy.
Those who decide our laws are the same people who decided
that public copyright harassment, erosion of civil liberties
and abominations of censorship such as COICA, ACTA,
and the DEAct, are good and just things to enforce upon
the populace. They do this whilst selectively enforcing their
own laws when it comes to “official” organizations that
take actions such as running a mass racketeering operation
(knowingly suing thousands of individuals for infringement
on bad evidence) or DDoSing sites that are contrary to their
interests (AiPlex). We do not recognize their “authority” due
to this rank hypocrisy.
Finally, we recognize and respect the work of Pirate
Parties and wish them luck. We hope that you all continue
your fight as we are continuing ours.36
As this letter signals, AnonOps became reflexive and unabashedly comfortable about stylizing its activities as civil
disobedience. Soon after reaching an ethical consensus on
DDoSing in November, the numbers on their IRC server
dwindled precipitously. Only a smattering of secret cabals
remained, tied up in their separate, clandestine channels. It
was impossible to forecast that, just three weeks later, they
would launch the largest DDoS civil disobedience campaign
the world had ever witnessed.

The Shot Heard Round the World
I’ve only just a minute,
Only sixty seconds in it.
Forced upon me, can’t refuse it,
Didn’t seek it, didn’t choose it,
But it’s up to me to use it.
I must suffer if I lose it,
Give an account if I abuse it
Just a tiny little minute,
But eternity is in it.
—Benjamin Elijah Mays,
American educator and president
of Morehouse College
Commentators often cast Anonymous as an amorphous
and formless entity existing in some mythical and primordial jelly-like state of non-being, only solidifying
into existence when an outside agent utters its name. Buying
into this logic, some writers suggest that Anonymous and its
interventions suffer from an inherent lack of cohesion. “The
group’s hazy message, with no spokesmen, leaders, or firm
political plans to provide steady direction,” Art Keller wrote
for Newsweek, “isn’t helped by an ideology that veers between
extreme left, extreme right and mainstream concerns.”1
 A more 
114 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
prosaic example comes from an Anon himself who relayed the
following to me during a personal chat conversation: “I spoke
to a real life friend today about Anonymous and he seemed
to have some vision of disembodied brains held in suspension
orbiting the earth in battle satellites or something, the idea
that actual people were involved seemed to flummox him.”
These generalizations—promulgated by the media and commoners alike—are not only mostly wrong, but they also lead
us further away from actually understanding Anonymous. Far
from lacking structure or flailing wildly about like a compass
at the North Pole, Anonymous incorporates an abundance
of relationships, structures, and moral positions. Human
beings—speaking, coding, debating, arguing, making art,
and acting—are there every step of the way. This sentiment
found a particularly nice expression during a conversation I
had with Mustafa Al-Bassam, a notable former member of
LulzSec, a hacker group that broke away from Anonymous.
Exasperated by attempts to catalog every secret channel and
collate every relevant note, I found him online one day and
pestered him—begged him, really—to provide a neat, tidy,
and definitive list of all the channels he could remember. He
kindly acquiesced and in the middle of his meticulous explanation, which still left me confused, he asked, “Do you know
kittencore?”
Oh damn, kittenporn?, I thought to myself. Thankfully, he
reined in my imagination and clarified: “The IRC channel—we
had a channel called #kittencore, and another called #upperdeck. The only difference is that #upperdeck had all the same
people in #kittencore but one less.” I asked why they kept one
person in the dark. He replied, “Because he came very late into
it and we became reluctant to have him in the center and also
because he came just as we were splitting the bitcoins.”
“Micro-micro-politics and cabals nested within cabals,” I
replied.
It is precisely this mixture of concreteness and abundance—
one channel, exactly the same as the other, minus one person, 
since he is too new and not yet trustworthy—which makes
Anonymous both so difficult to describe and so resistant to
being slotted into a pre-fabricated mental template. Within
Anonymous, the pressure and desire to efface the public
presentation of self allows the participants to perform an
admixture of their souls, conjuring into existence something
always emergent and in flux. The number of relationships, fiefdoms, and cliques in simultaneous existence is largely invisible
to the public, which tends to see Anonymous from the vantage
point of carefully sculpted propaganda and the media’s rather
predictable gaze.
And yet, peering through the computer, we find Anonymous
in any instant to be an aggregate sack of flesh—meshed together
by wires, transistors, and wi-fi signals—replete with miles of
tubes pumping blood, pounds of viscera filled with vital fluids,
an array of live signaling wires, propped up by a skeletal structure with muscular pistons fastened to it, and ruled from a
cavernous dome holding a restless control center, the analog
of these fabulously grotesque and chaotically precise systems
that, if picked apart, become what we call people. Anonymous
is no different from us. It simply consists of humans sitting at
their glowing screens and typing, as humans are wont to do at
this precise moment in the long arc of the human condition.
Each body taken alone provides the vector for an irreducibly unique and complex individual history—mirroring in its
isolation the complexity of all social phenomena as a whole—
which can itself be reduced yet further, to the order of events:
mere flights of fingers and an occasional mouse gesture which
register elsewhere, on a screen, as a two-dimensional text or a
three-dimensional video; the song their fingers play on these
keyboards ringing forth in a well-orchestrated, albeit cacophonous and often discordant, symphony; it is sung in the most
base and lewd verse, atonal and unmetered, yet enthralling to
many: the mythical epic of Anonymous.
Anonymous was not always this complex; it was only in
late 2010 that the activist group became such a tangled and
The Shot Heard Round the World 115
116 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
constantly shifting labyrinth. In November 2010, the minotaur
running the maze of Anonymous had not yet found its escape
route into the world, but it was getting closer. Chanology was
still ongoing and AnonOps’ IRC remained the central nerve
center for a cavalcade of DDoS campaigns lobbed against
the copyright industry. By the end of November, this steady
stream of direct action in support of file sharing came to a
screeching halt. Participation in the public-facing IRC channels dwindled to an all time low. But the core teams, who had
collaborated on the private channels, did not quietly shutter
the doors and close up shop (though the low numbers did
worry them). Instead, they sought to organize themselves
better. A brainstorming session resulted in a collaboratively
written document hashing out the purpose and structure
of the private channel #command, which scandalized the
broader ranks of Anonymous publicized earlier in November
(see figure on facing page).
The document, which existed in various garish states, first
defined the limited role of #command as “act[ing] as an intermediary” that “does not take decisions alone” and should
lead “only the discussion, not the direction” of the operations.
The document ends with a list of rules, including the ironic
pronouncement that “only grownups” are allowed to be in
“Command.” Ironic because a number of the individuals were
under eighteen (and really, Anonymous as “grownup”?).
There are many concepts embedded in this document that
are likely unfamiliar to IRC virgins and could bear some
explanation. First: you use an IRC client to connect to a server,
and then you pick a handle or “nick”—this could be your
legal name, but more typically it’s something else. You have
the option to speak one-on-one with other connected users,
or you can join “channels,” which are denoted by a preceding
octothorpe (#) and can be joined by any user who knows of
the room’s existence—assuming it’s not an invite-only room.
Once you join a room, you converse with other users who are
there, typically about a channel-specifc topic. Whoever creates 
the channel is called the channel “founder” and has a certain
amount of power to change its properties, determining who can
enter, whether the channel is visible in the server’s list of public
channels, and so forth. These operators can also bestow—at
least in some versions of IRC—power on others, adding them
to what’s called the “AutoOp (AOP)” list. Anyone on that list
can “kick” anyone else out of the channel for whatever reason
they choose, and even ban them from returning. At a higher
order of power are the IRCops—a fraction who run the server
and have the power to not only kick people from individual
channels, but also from the server itself, disconnecting them
completely. IRCops also have the ability to alter individual
channel configurations and perform many other administrative functions. Typically, there are many individual channel
operators but few IRC server operators. For many IRCops,
getting involved in any individual channel’s dispute is a frustrating exercise—requiring them to pass judgment on events
they were not privy to. As a result, channel decisions are typically deferred to the channel operators, with a server admin
intervening only in extreme circumstances.
Many participants draw (or at least seek to draw) sensible
lines of order from IRC and other stable sites of interaction.
The Shot Heard Round the World 117
Rules in Command:
•  Nobody kicks and certainly not bans inside command.
•  Don’t interrupt another one’s subject.
•  First point out the matters at hand, then point out priorities.
•  People who troll in command get (permanently) thrown out of the AOP
list.
•  Personal disputes are taboo.
•  Grown-ups only.
•  No offtopic subjects in (staff) discussions.
•  Pointing out problems in a structured way: name problem, suggest
solution. If you can’t hint a solution, then at least give evidence or argue
your statements, as long as your point is valid.
•  If you don’t like somebody, get over it. Were all in this together.
•  Admins/OPs are considered an example. Act on that behavior!
•  Don’t expect IRCops to sort out all your problems, try it yourself, if all else
fails, ask OP!

This order, nevertheless, is delicate and precarious—always
on the edge of disorder. However, like so many trickster
scenarios of turmoil, these moments of chaos don’t necessarily
lead to breakdown and stasis. Instead, they often function as
beginnings—necessary for the vitality and even regeneration
of the broader community. Juxtaposing two quotes, one by
Spanish philosopher George Santayana and another by Henry
Brooks Adams, puts this lesson into relief:
Chaos is a name for any order that produces confusion in
our minds but it won’t be chaos once we see it for what it is.
Chaos often breeds life, when order breeds habit.
In the somewhat tangled story I am about to tell, it will be clear
how Anonymous, like most social movements, remains open
to chance, and chaos. The difference being that Anonymous is
perhaps just a touch more open to mutation. Nowhere do we
see this demonstrated more vividly than at the beginning of
December 2010, when a whimsical decision ended a period of
inactivity in AnonOps, flinging open the door for new actionable possibilities and allowing scores of newcomers to arrive
as ready conscripts (mostly unaware, again, of the still-private
#command IRC channel). This decision revitalized AnonOps
to such a degree that the group’s IRC network became a fountain of nonstop activity for over a year, surpassing WikiLeaks
as the primary hacker-activist hub of the Internet.
But, before we describe this whimsical decision, we would
do well to keep in mind its infamous outcome: AnonOps’
support of WikiLeaks via a massive DDoS campaign in the
aftermath of the whistleblowing organization’s most contentious release yet. On November 28, 2010, WikiLeaks publicly
released 220 of 251,287 classified US diplomatic cables—
the most extensive leak of classified materials ever, timed to
coincide with in-depth analyses by the Guardian, the New
York Times, El País, Le Monde, and Der Spiegel. The US 
government was furious, and a trio of powerful companies—
Amazon, MasterCard, and PayPal (among others)—bowed to
its influence, refusing to process donations or provide website
hosting for the embattled organization.
Even though WikiLeaks had already released hundreds of
thousands of military documents about the Afghan and Iraq
wars, which brimmed with revelations of detention squads,
civilian casualties, the solicitation of child prostitutes, and
a host of other horrors, “Cablegate” still managed to stand
in a class of its own. It pulled back the curtain on not only
the intra-diplomatic discussions that were normally hidden
behind a veil of diplomatic etiquette, and also—and even
more salaciously—on the internal discussions and intelligence
gathering of US diplomats themselves. Then–Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton had in 2009, we learned, merged diplomacy
and spying into one activity, ordering US diplomatic officials
to collect credit card numbers, frequent flyer numbers, and
biometric information on foreign officials. We learned for the
first time that the Obama administration had been secretly
conducting a war in Yemen, launching missile attacks at
suspected terrorists, while the Yemeni government covered
it up by claiming responsibility themselves. We learned that
American intelligence agencies believed that North Korea
had given Iran nineteen of its longest-range missiles—which
the public didn’t know existed in the first place. We learned
that Saudi Arabian leaders had been urging the United States
to bomb Iran in order to, as King Abdullah himself put it,
“cut off the head of the snake.” The cables showed that Israel
was bluffing on its threat to launch airstrikes against Iran,
and that the United States engaged in criminal dealings with
the corrupt, drug-trafficking brother of Afghan president
Hamid Karzai. The cables also touched on comparably banal
subjects, like US diplomats’ routine bad-mouthing and namecalling of foreign leaders.2
 Previously, things were merely
interesting and provocative. But now, as the revelations kept
coming, members of the public discovered their jaws dropping

lower and lower by the day, as if they were strapped into some
orthodontic-transparency device, hand-cranked by Julian
Assange himself.
Sarah Palin suggested Assange be hunted down “with the
same urgency we pursue al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders.”3
Senator Joe Lieberman declared it “an outrageous, reckless,
and despicable action that will undermine the ability of our
government and our partners to keep our people safe and to
work together to defend our vital interests.”4
 Lieberman’s staff
reached out to Amazon—not only the world’s largest book
retailer but also its largest web host—and asked it to ban
WikiLeaks from its servers. It acquiesced. The financial firms
that process credit card transactions worldwide followed suit,
cutting the umbilical cord between donors and WikiLeaks.
Although WikiLeaks had not been found guilty of anything
by any court of law—these companies, without any legal obligation to do what the government asked of them, went ahead
anyway. Anonymous was outraged.
Two weeks later, AnonOps became ground zero for the
single largest digital direct action campaign the Internet
had—and still has—ever witnessed, at least when measured
by number of participants. Over seven thousand individuals
logged onto AnonOps’ IRC channel, #operationpayback, to
lend a helping hand, cheer or, at the very least, simply spectate. Seven thousand users in one channel remains the largest
single human IRC congregation ever.5
 It was a “mass demo
against control,” as free software hacker Richard Stallman
described the event in a Guardian editorial.6
 In the month of
December alone, LOIC was downloaded 116,988 times, far
more than during the earlier DDoS campaigns.7
 While only a
fraction of those actually connected to the Anonymous hive,
interest in the tool was undoubtedly fueled by reporting on
Anonymous’s activities.
Media attention was frenzied, catapulting this collective
of collectives out of relative obscurity and into the international spotlight. Not only did the usual suspects—like 
technology-oriented publications and blogs—report on the
uprising, but so did most of the major nightly news programs.
CNN hosted the digital strategist Nicco Mele, who praised
Anonymous during an in-depth interview. In the New York
Times, one of the Internet’s original patron saints, John Perry
Barlow, cast the Anonymous campaign as “the shot heard
round the world—this is Lexington.”8
WikiLeaks and Anonymous seemed like a perfect fit.
Anonymous’s DDoS campaign solidified the alliance through
a spectacular display of solidarity and support. But, as hinted
at before, AnonOps’ decision to intervene came about in a
rather convoluted, disorderly manner. Journalist Parmy Olson,
in her book We Are Anonymous, portrays AnonOps’ decision
to rally around WikiLeaks as straightforward:
The people who set up AnonOps were talking about the
WikiLeaks controversy in their private #command channel.
They were angry at PayPal, but, more than that, they saw an
opportunity. The victimization of Wiklileaks, they figured,
would strike a chord with Anonymous and bring hordes of
users to their new network. It was great publicity.9
But this account barely scratches the surface of what transpired. AnonOps was in idle mode, with almost no supporters
outside of the core team. This so-called “opportunity” only
manifested once AnonOps command was forced to consider
involving themselves following the independent actions of
only a few unknown Anons, thus opening the floodgates for
thousands.
It could be said that the initial nudge that reinvigorated the
team behind Operation Payback, pushing them into Operation
Avenge Assange, came from a rather wordy poster. It showered
Assange with praise: “Julian Assange deifies everything we
hold dear. He despises and fights censorship constantly [and]
is probably the most successful troll of all time … Now Julian
is the prime focus of a global manhunt, in both physical and
The Shot Heard Round the World 121
122 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
virtual realms.” It then called on Anonymous to “kick back for
Julian” by engaging in multiple political acts from DDoSing
PayPal to complaining “to your local MP.”
On December 4, as this message traversed the Internet, an
unknown party DDoSed the PayPal blog—most likely with a
botnet.10 This action was followed by a trickle of journalistic
coverage and a statement on the PandaLabs security blog that
announced, in a matter-of-fact way, AnonOps’ involvement:
“The organizers behind the anonymous group responsible
for Operation: Payback are in the midst of refocusing their
campaign to assist WikiLeaks in their quest to release classified government documents.”11 This was all news to many
in Anonymous. As media reports continued to roll out, a
convoluted and angry conversation broke out in AnonOps’
#command chat room. Most of the team had no idea they
were “refocusing their efforts on WikiLeaks.”
To make sense of this moment, it might help to follow a few
members of Anonymous (all pseudonyms have been changed)
through the events that unfolded on December 6. We will
start with Fred, one of the most important participants on
#command (according to one interview subject, “[Fred] is
AnonOps”). Fred invested a serious amount of time maintaining the infrastructure. A Kurt Vonnegut adage comes to
mind: “Another flaw in the human character is that everybody
wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.” Fred
was willing to do the work others took for granted, and as a
result he was heavily invested in AnonOps. On that day, as
Fred logged into #command, he was very angry. A conversation would transpire over the next hour that would forever
change the future course of both AnonOps (specifically) and
Anonymous (in general):
<Fred>: offs [oh for fuck’s sake]
<Fred>: that operation assange thing is just a poster
<Fred>: no site names, nothing
<Fred>: its not ours
Trogo (author of the PandaLabs blog post) was on the channel.
He was one of a handful of embedded outsiders given access
to the secret areas—typically there were very few of them—in
order to ferret information out of the AnonOps bunkers and
into the public domain. (Trogo, however, stands unique for
being around #command since its founding.) It seemed that
a statement published by Trogo had catalyzed many into the
actions now under review. Trogo defended his hasty decision
to publish without broad consensus.
<Trogo>: [It was] approved by Radwaddie [another member of
#command]
<Trogo>: We ran with the name because media has a short attention
span
<Trogo> [to captor]: Last night I wrote a blog post announcing the
change of plans
<captor> [to trogo]: what change of plans?
A change of plans had indeed been decided by those chatting
in AnonOps—but most Anons, even those in #command, had
not been invited to take part in the decision-making process.
As this became increasingly clear to those who were left out
in the cold, many expressed dismay and confusion. “It seems
many here are unaware,” wrote Fred. As blame circulated,
others, dumbfounded, defended themselves: “it’s not us, we
are not firing at paypal.”
Despite being an outsider, Trogo proceeded to remind the
Anons how Anonymous works: the name is free to be taken by
any who would take it. Someone noted the irony of raising this
ostensibly well-known fact to Anonymous (and in what was
perhaps the most important Anonymous IRC channel at the
time, no less). And in addition to stating the obvious, the security researcher and blogger defended himself by characterizing
what happened as being “nothing new.” He was well aware that
the channel had already largely decided to support WikiLeaks,
even if its commitment to mirror the site by duplicating its
The Shot Heard Round the World 123
124 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
content had not yet been actualized. Recognizing that what
was done was done, Radwaddie switched from a defensive
stance to an offensive one, making a vigorous attempt to convince the disgruntled parties to embrace the momentum and
push forward, hitting PayPal regardless of the strategy that
had already been chosen:
<Radwaddie>: since we all agree on that [helping WikiLeaks]
<Radwaddie>: why aren’t we hitting paypal?
<Fred>: because no one knew we were suppose ot?
<Radwaddie>: i mean, shit hitting the fan already, might as well help
them
It was a shrewd and opportunistic move—and almost immediately consensus started to favor jumping into the fray. But
there were calls for due process. If they wanted to do it right,
they first needed to rev up their propaganda machine. And
even as some were swayed toward DDoSing PayPal, the
growing anger (particularly directed at Radwaddie and Trogo
for violating decision-making protocol) spread to others:
<dubiosdudious> [to Radwaddie]: who are you to make all the
decisions?
<Radwaddie> [to dubiosdudious]: you wanna sit down and have a
cup of tea over it and discuss the next cause of action?
[…]
<Radwaddie> [to dubiosdudious]: what’s your objection (bulletpoint
please)
<dubiosdudious>: 1. no preparations
<dubiosdudious>: 2. no vote
<dubiosdudious>: on the top of my head
As Radwaddie attempted to push the campaign forward in
spite of attacks thrown his way, semantic arguments broke
out over the role of #command in general. Radwaddie yelledtyped: “ok, the fuck, WHO THE FUCK IN HERE HAS ANY 
IDEA AT ALL?” And as the seed germinated amid the gathered
Anons, the debate slowly—perhaps inexorably—shifted from
a question of whether to hit PayPal to a question of where to hit
PayPal. Most participants favored the “main site.” Radwaddie
then interwove pragmatic and moral arguments: “we’re trying
to make a point, [that] we disagree with paypal [which is why]
we do the thing we do best: ddos.” He wrote that this was
what Anonymous was about, not “awesome speeches or fabulous community.” Just as support for Radwaddie’s position
seemed poised to reach a consensus, someone named “lark”
entered the room with a surprising nugget of information:
“the [initial] attack on the paypal blog was one of our own
as a side project.” So, in fact, the very first DDoS hit, which
everyone thought was instigated by an unaffiliated Anon, happened to be carried out by one of their own. I guess he had
just gone about his business quietly, since AnonOps at the time
was primarily focused on supporting file sharing.
But despite this revelation, it seemed that the momentum
could not be stopped. Given the hubbub generated by Trogo
and Radwaddie’s decision to piggyback on the first DDoS hit,
which everyone thought was accomplished by an outsider, it
might seem incredulous that no one responded to lark. But
we can imagine that the Anons were at this point so deeply
immersed in their course of action—debating targets and
strategy—that this single statement was easy to overlook.
The conversation simply continued. Finally, an announcement
came:
<captor>: DONE
<captor>: we have target [the paypal main site]
The propaganda team was notified and the attack commenced
(with botnets being secretly deployed). Conversation naturally
shifted to consider the significance of enlarging the scope of
Operation Payback (aka “o:p”) to include other matters aside
from copyright and piracy:
The Shot Heard Round the World 125
126 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Mobile>: so o:p has turned into a war on censorship and copyright?
<Radwaddie>: and we see this as a sideOP, we’re not suspending our
“normal” activities
[…]
<Trogo>: Is it even possible to DDoS PayPal?
<Radwaddie> [to Trogo]: we will find out, won’t we?
The attack, unbeknownst to all participating, was no longer
just a “sideOP” initiated by the Anons in #command—instead,
it was the opening salvo that would galvanize a global movement, ushering in a new age of Anonymous. This new node
would boast thousands of participants, and would be borne
not out of an obvious and straightforward determination,
but, rather, out of confusion: a mixture of manipulation, false
information, good intentions, and rampant uncertainty.
They Didn’t Seek It, They Didn’t Choose It
The answer to Trogo’s question—“Is it even possible to DDoS
PayPal?”—turned out to be “yes.” (The same turned out to be
true of MasterCard and many financial companies.) What had
been conceived as a mere diversion metamorphized, rather
quickly, into the apotheosis of AnonOps. Between December
6, 2010, and December 8, 2010, AnonOps expanded its
scope, targeting not only the PayPal blog and the PayPal
website, but also the Swedish prosecutor’s websites (as the
Swedish government was seeking to extradite Assange on rape
charges)12 and the websites of Senator Joe Leiberman, Sarah
Palin, MasterCard, Visa, EveryDNS (a domain name service
provider), and others. Exacting vengeance against any party
complicit in the smearing of WikiLeaks, AnonOps caused all
of these sites to experience some amount of downtime, though
the exact hours vary depending on who you ask. By December
8, numbers on the main IRC #operationpayback channel
spiked to an all-time high of 7,800. 
These examples demonstrate how Anonymous’s tactics
conform to Michel de Certeau’s account of “everyday tactics
of resistance” whereby “a tactic depends on time—it is always
on the watch for opportunities that must be seized ‘on the
wing.’”13 Radwaddie and Trogo decided to act independent of
the group, seizing exactly this sort of timely opportunity; this
style of on-the-fly decision making is an Anonymous staple.
The group is often reactive rather than proactive; to paraphrase the poem which opens the chapter: the decision was
forced upon them, they could not refuse it, they did not seek
it, they didn’t choose it, but it was up to them. To fully execute
the operation nevertheless required considerable organization
and resources, which in this case took the form of zombie and
voluntary botnets and propaganda.
What made the difference was both simple and simply
beyond Anonymous’s control: it was the general indignation
regarding the payment blockade. The Internet was awash in
articles and tweets expressing dismay; everyone was asking
some version of the question posed by a UK journalist on
Twitter: “Of what have either Assange or Wiki-leaks [sic]
actually been convicted, that allows VISA, Mastercard, PayPal,
Amazon to withdraw service this week?”14 To illustrate the
hypocrisy of it all, people pointed out that while MasterCard
refused to process payments for WikiLeaks, racists around
the world remained free to donate to their racist organization of choice, like the Klu Klux Klan. Internet scholar Zeynep
Tufekci issued the following warning:
The WikiLeaks furor shows us that these institutions of
power are slowly and surely taking control of the key junctures of the Internet. As a mere “quasi-public sphere,” the
Internet is somewhat akin to shopping malls, which seem
like public spaces but in which the rights of citizens are
restricted, as they are in fact private.15
The Shot Heard Round the World 127

Everyone was indeed confronting this cold hard reality: the
Internet, so often experienced as a public space, is in fact a
privatized zone, with the Amazons and PayPals of the world
able to shut down conversation and commerce.
The mood in certain quarters at the time was captured in
the following statement by an activist who went by the Twitter
name “AnonyOps” (no relation to AnonOps, even if the names
bear an unmistakable resemblance):
I remember a mountain of angst building up and I didn’t
realize until that day that it wasn’t a mountain. It was a
volcano and the day that WikiLeaks donations were held,
the volcano blew and that’s the day I searched for a way to
call out the bullshit. A way for me to talk publicly, without
jeopardizing my career.16
A skilled and wealthy engineer in his thirties, he created the
AnonyOps Twitter account (it would eventually become one
of the largest multiple-author Anonymous accounts) and, like
so many others, logged into IRC.
AnonOps, because it was not some amorphous blob but
rather a team with a dedicated volunteer force and resources,
had erected a platform from which all kinds of people could act.
Confusion and happenstance mingled with operational readiness and the deployment of resources. Droves of concerned
citizens from all over world flocked to the renegade army.
“Goodnight, and sweet dreams from AnonOps”
In the fall of 2010, when AnonOps was banging out wave
upon wave of DDoS attacks under Operation Payback, I had
taken a leave of absence from Anonymous to finish my first
book on free software hacking. I was behind on the book,
and with my tenure clock ticking, the pressure was on. It was
psychologically crushing me: to retain my job, I had to publish 
a book. So I set aside the month of December to sprint to the
finish line. When Anonymous resurfaced as an activist force in
early December, I trusted my Spidey sense: it struck me as too
historically significant to ignore. I put aside my manuscript
and gave my attention to Anonymous. To be entirely frank, the
gamble felt safe; extrapolating from previous actions, I figured
it would peter out, or at least slow down, after a month, and
I could then return to writing. But instead I remained chained
to my computer for roughly three years.
At the height of the holidays that December, I went to
the West Coast to spend time with my family. While family
members went hiking on rugged cliffs overlooking the shimmering Pacific Ocean and watched movies late into the night, I
huddled over my laptop. I was engrossed, dumbfounded, mystified, and addicted to the wild energy and excitement coursing
through the channels. I’m pretty sure my family thought I was
being purposely antisocial, and for good reason. I was hands
down the scrooge of the bunch, never quite as excited as everyone else about holiday cheer, eggnog, or (most especially) the
board games they loved and I loathed. In any given year, a half
dozen excuses were ready to roll off my tongue at the mere
hint of Settlers of Catan.
For most of my family, the Internet represents the dreaded
chore of email; it’s the place where they read the morning news
over coffee, skim Facebook for the latest pictures of friends
and their cherubic babies, and, in moments of workplace desperation, fire up those fantastic cat videos. The Internet is all
these things for me as well, but also more—a place of multiple
worlds, a galaxy really. For them, it is simply not a “place”
where something like the anti–World Trade Organization
protests, which took Seattle by surprise over ten years ago,
could possibly happen. And, undoubtedly, there is an ocean of
difference between tear gas and typing. Incommensurabilities
aside, one thing was certain: I was witnessing the first largescale, populist, full-bodied online protest, and I was not going
to miss it for the world, especially not for the Settlers of Catan.

After a long day of research, I wanted nothing more than
to describe to my relatives the passionate and rambunctious
scenes I had witnessed. But I fumbled to find the adequate
words and terminology. For weeks I struggled to get a handle
on things and judge just what sort of “mass demo” was taking
place. Questions rather than answers sprung to mind: Was it
civil disobedience? Direct action? Something akin to a street
demonstration? A virtual sit-in? A blockade? Did DDoS
attacks violate free speech and essential liberties, as some
critics claimed? Was it ethical, unethical, effective, ineffective?
Who were all these people, anyway?
I had only a vague idea at the start. There were so many nicknames zinging by me on IRC. Soon I would incessantly chat
with a number of them, and eventually I would meet a smaller
slice in person. But, at the time, they were mysteries to me. I
had no clue about the existence of secret back channels; I was
primarily viewing the conversations on #operationpayback
and other public channels. I also had to learn just how LOIC
worked at a technical level, and I had to read up on AnonOps’
fall DDoS campaigns. The pace and the sheer number of participants made all previous conversations I had witnessed
on IRC seem trivial. Even though I was expending very little
physical energy—sitting all day, staring at conversations—by
the end of the day my head ached. I was worn out, and torn
as to my opinion on things. It took a few weeks to process the
ethics of how Anonymous ran its DDoS campaigns.
The amount of information-processing required of participants was staggering. Logging into the main channel, a screen
popped up displaying the topic and a terse condensation of
target information: the IP address to enter into LOIC, Twitter
channels you should check out for context, and other IRC
channels worth visiting. Typically, it looked something like
this:
(04:56:18 PM) The topic for #opb is: OPERATION PAYBACK

In conjunction, Anonymous was churning out a slew of wellreasoned manifestos, videos, and posters; Anonymous had
tapped into a deep, widespread disenchantment, and by providing a conduit for confrontational activism, had channeled
it into a more visible and coherent form. It was as if everybody
knew it was history in the making: the first popular uprising
on the Internet. Strangers were reaching out to work toward a
common goal. I myself was inspired.
The conversations were a whole other matter. With thousands of people logged in and up to a hundred users talking at
once, it was wildly cacophonous and required every last shred
of my already ADHD-addled brain to follow. Indeed, there
is probably no other medium on earth as conducive to what
literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin terms “polyphony” (multiple
voices, each with a unique perspective and moral weight) than
IRC.17 And while some would come to describe Anonymous
as “a microcosm of anarchy, with no morals, empathy, or
agenda,”18 I witnessed something altogether different: everyone had a moral viewpoint, a reason for being there. They
cared, wanted justice, wanted to end censorship (and some
even were there to disagree—vehemently—with the tactics
being used). Yes: Anonymous had no universal mandate as
a collective, but participants had their own, often well-tuned
moral compasses guiding them.
To take but one example from among dozens of issues being
hotly debated: in December 2010, #operationpayback was
home to a vociferous debate over the effectiveness and ethics
of technological protest in general, and DDoSing in particular.
Two subtopics stood out: the safety of LOIC, and the more
The Shot Heard Round the World 131
132 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
philosophical question of whether DDoSing is an exercise
of the right to free speech or an act aimed at precluding the
same right for others. The excerpts from two distinct conversations below exemplify the polyphonous character of these
interchanges and the multiplicity of ethical positions on these
technological protests. These issues were visited and revisited
throughout the course of the month.
Early in the campaign, participants grappled with the political significance of Anonymous, with most everyone expressing
support for DDoS:
<P>: this is better than WTO Seattle
[…]
<P>: bottom up approach
<z>: you need a critical mass though, before people start feeling
inspired
<z>: 2 or 3 people standing around doesn’t look epic, it looks lame
<a>: this attack seems pretty unorganized right now
<z>: it’s gotta go viral, you know?
<P>: pretty appealing message imo
[…]
<a>: I think these attacks are less about hurting the businesses than
drawing attention and forcing the media to cover the story
<a>: most people I know have never even heard about WikiLeaks
until I bring it up
[…]
<a>: The point for me is that this is the technological way of mass
protesting that’s actually effective so until there’s total freedom of
information then there isn’t an end.
[…]
<m>: theres nothing wrong with technological protest. other than we
struggle to organize. do any damage. hardly any of us are propper
hackers.
<P>: synchronized twitter and facebook postings, jolly rogers
wherever you can on the internet, and then a manifesto about how
to take to your local street corner and do something
[…]
<P>: anon can get it moving, but this is bigger than anon
A few days later on the same channel, a few ripped DDoSing
apart, as others continued to defend it:
<26>: i dont think DDoS can be in the name of freedom of speech
<26>: cause it is an act of silencing
<matty>: ^
<sc>: think of a target as a sign on a building
secreta: its pretty clear how hypocritical a ddos is to me
<PN>: you keep screaming that everyone is going to jail. you are just
here to discourage. cunt.
<sc>: you do not agree with what that building represents
<26>: but people are going to jail
<ri>: DO NOT BE AFRAID OF JAIL
[…]
<ri>: every civil rights protest ends with people in gail
For the great majority of participants who contributed or used
LOIC, it is safe to assume that they considered this tool and
tactic a morally acceptable method of protest. Whether LOIC
was in fact legal is a different question. At the time, the AnonOps
party line affirmed that DDoSing with LOIC was safe: not
because the tool anonymized your IP address (it did not, and
generally no one claimed it did), but because the huge numbers
of individuals participating would make it nearly impossible,
or at least unduly inconvenient, for authorities to track down
and arrest everyone. The main operators in the #operationpayback channel, some of whom were also in #command,
would, in rare moments, ban those who warned others of its
illegality. Those in #command wanted to instill trust, not fear,
in their methods. AnonOps also circulated “instructions” for
how to use LOIC, which featured atrocious security advice
coupled with the overly pushy—and extremely dubious—
legal advice in case of arrest:
The Shot Heard Round the World 133
134 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
IF YOU ARE V& [vanned] declare you had no participation
in this event. Note you are using a dynamic IP address and
that many different people use it, because it’s dynamic. If
they prove that it was yours, then tell them you are a victim
of a “botnet virus” that you had no control or knowledge of.
Additionally if you set your wireless to unsecured or WAP
prior to LOIC you can claim someone hacked your wireless.
Case closed.19
More shockingly, a small cohort of journalists also spread
misinformation. While Anonymous could, perhaps, be understood and forgiven for its mistakes, journalists should have
done their homework rather than relaying incorrect legal
advice and misleading technical information provided by
their sources. The most egregious example of this practice
came from the popular tech news site Gizmodo on December
8, 2010, in an article entitled “What Is LOIC?”: “
Because a
DDoS knocks everything offline—at least when it works
as intended—the log files that would normally record each
incoming connection typically just don’t work.”20 This point is
just plain wrong. The DDoS’ed site can still monitor its traffic,
culling and keeping IP addresses, which can be subsequently
used to identify participants.
LOIC was about as safe as a torn condom. If a person using
LOIC did not take other measures to cloak their IP address, it
would be plain in every packet—in every attack—transmitted.
Many participants likely lacked even rudimentary knowledge of how the technology worked, a baseline necessity for
making an informed decision. The heat of the moment and
the dominant sense of safety swept up journalists and participants alike. Generally speaking, and with a few exceptions,
most people involved in #command, however naive the position might seem in hindsight, were, I think, sincere in believing
that protection followed from strength in numbers; some of
the individuals in #command used LOIC themselves and were
subsequently arrested. 
For much of the fall of 2010, Anons used DDoS with no
repercussions, boosting the false sense of confidence that
would soon evaporate under the first FBI raids at the end of
December. There was also the issue of personalized messages
accompanying the DDoS attacks. When individuals connected
to the AnonOps hive, and packets were sent to a target, it
included a message: “Goodnight, and sweet dreams from
AnonOps.” The government could surely use this message to
counteract claims that the sender was ignorantly a “victim of
a botnet virus.” But with a good lawyer, that argument would
crumble because the message could be identified as part of the
virus (problem is, good lawyers are pricey). Regardless, none
of this was discussed or seemingly understood.
The tide changed quickly. Soon after the first wave of
attacks, a poster warning that LOIC was unsafe made the
rounds. The bad advice presented by sites like Gizmodo was
soon set straight by carefully researched articles on sites
like Boing Boing, providing warnings and accurate technical details about LOIC’s security vulnerabilities. Around this
time, a talented programmer managed to corral a small team
of Anons to start writing a more secure, but harder to use,
version. Upon release, it was downloaded en masse—before
people realized it contained a trojan.
Finally, irrefutable proof of traceability arrived: law enforcement in plain blue jackets with yellow FBI letters visited over
forty homes across the United States, trucking out hard drives
loaded with incriminating data. Eventually, in July 2011, the
FBI arrested fourteen alleged participants, thirteen of whom
have since pled guilty. In October 2013, a grand jury indicted
thirteen American citizens for participating in Avenge Assange
and some of the earlier Operation Payback attacks.21
Now everyone knew that LOIC was an unsafe tool; that
the US government was willing to go after online political
protesters, even those who had not used LOIC (some of the
participants swept in by the DDoS raid never used LOIC or
botnets, but were charged based on IRC log conversations);
The Shot Heard Round the World 135
136 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
and that there was no safety in numbers. Presumably, a hard
lesson was learned.
DDoS as a Moral Pretzel
Equipped with these details, what ethical and historical
insights might be drawn from these extraordinary direct action
events—the largest DDoS political demonstration the web has
seen? By fall 2010, the use of DDoS attacks was an established political tactic among hacktivists; Anonymous by no
means pioneered the technique. In the 1990s and early 2000s,
the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), for instance, staged
DDoS campaigns that they labeled “virtual sit-ins.” These
actions combined technical interventions with poeticism and
performance art. EDT targeted Mexican government websites
to publicize the plight of Zapatistas fighting for autonomy in
Chiapas, Mexico.22 They distributed press releases before the
events and, while drawing less than a few hundred participants
and causing no downtime to the sites, succeeded (somewhat)
in the goal of gaining media attention. Regardless, the action
hardly qualified, as Molly Sauter has perceptively argued, as
“disruptive,”23 and it never reached a saturation point in the
mainstream press.
Anonymous altered the scale, expression, and effects of
DDoSing enough that the group broke the mold it inherited.
Rather than spending months organizing small, well-crafted
events, Anonymous experimented with the art of harnessing realtime anger into a wild, unpredictable, and continual uprising.
As with any form of public assembly, alongside the politically
motivated were those along just for the ride—and also those
who were there simply to make the ride as bumpy and wild
as possible. It’s inevitable that participants in Anonymous will
have an array of positions and desired ends, given the group’s
philosophical platform and the accessibility of its software tools;
the actions are open to seasoned activists and newcomers alike.
By considering this tactic historically, we can plainly see
that DDoSing is nothing new—virtually every movement
advocating social change in the past two hundred years (from
abolitionists to ACT UP) has relied on large-scale, rowdy, disruptive tactics to draw attention and demand change.24 The
novelty lay in how the availability of a software tool, LOIC,
and an Anonymous hype machine publicizing its existence,
enabled such sizable and disruptive demonstrations to take
root and unfold nearly spontaneously on the Internet. In a
detailed analysis of the tool’s features, Sauter convincingly
argues that the “Hive Mind mode” helped secure the hefty
numbers: “Although Anons may not have ‘hit the streets’ as
EDT envisioned Hive Mind mode did enable them to go to
school, work, sleep, or anywhere while still participating in
DDOS actions as they arose.”25
But even if DDoS simply extends a longer tradition of disruptive activism, it still sat uneasily with many Anons and
hackers—even those who had no issue with law breaking. One
day, chatting with an Anonymous hacker about the morality
of the protests, I was told, “Trying to find a sure-fire ethical
defense for Anonymous DDoSing is going to twist you into
moral pretzels.” Particularly troubling to many Anons was
the discovery that the DDoS campaigns in the fall and winter
of 2010, including Avenge Assange, were built on deceit and
buffered by the deployment of hacker-controlled botnets. Had
participants known that an army of zombie computers provided the ammunition, they might have chosen differently.
And yet, without this turbo boosting enabled by the hijacked
computers, the use of LOIC—even by thousands of willing,
ideologically committed participants, each contributing a
small bit of power—would never have resulted in the downtimes that generated the media attention that was sought. This
same hacker, critical of the technique, elaborated: “I have had
several discussions about DDoS with people who, similar to
myself, are not overly fond of it, but we keep coming back to
it, as it is effective; the media does drive a lot of this activity.”
The Shot Heard Round the World 137

It was pivotal. Robust public participation may not have
been technically necessary, and claims of LOIC’s safety were
atrociously off the mark, but without the appearance of a
critical mass, the operation would have likely lacked moral
gravitas and authority. In this case, strength in numbers conveyed a potent message, even if there was no safety in them
(and no technical need for them): it palpably revealed to the
world at large the scope of supporters’ disenchantment with
what they saw as corporate censorship.
Geeks and others also leveled more general critiques against
the tactic, struggling to analogize the DDoS campaign with
offline equivalents. Most persistent was the notion that DDoS
attacks trample the targets’ right to speak freely. If one takes
an absolutist view of free speech, then DDoS extinguishes the
possibility of speech by disabling access to a website expressing a set of views. This mirrors the position of some hackers,
like Oxblood Ruffin of the Cult of the Dead Cow, resolutely
against this tactic for decades. In an interview with CNET,
he reasoned: “Anonymous is fighting for free speech on the
Internet, but it’s hard to support that when you’re DoS-ing
and not allowing people to talk. How is that consistent?”26
He is right, up to a point. A more dynamic view of free
speech could take power relations into account. By enabling
the underdog—the protester or infringed group—to speak as
loudly as its more resourceful opponents (in this case, powerful corporations), we might understand a tactic like DDoS as
a leveler: a free speech win. I favor a more contextualized,
power-driven analysis of free speech. In the case of Avenge
Assange, PayPal and its kin never really lost their ability to
speak, and the action itself was in response to a unilateral
banking and service blockade that crippled WikiLeaks’ capability to speak or present a position. Where WikiLeaks had
one proactive outlet—its disabled website (and the occasional
sympathetic journalist)—many of the targets, like the MPAA
and PayPal, commanded lobbyists, advertisers, and media
contacts capable of distributing their message far and wide. 
But understanding DDoS as a modulator of free speech is
itself contentious. Others think it aligns more with another
traditional protest tactic: the direct action blockade. In one
debate among members of the Cult of the Dead Cow, hacker
Tod Gemuese declared the free speech analogy to be “hooey.”
He continued: “It’s the digital equivalent of physical-world
forms of protest such as padlocking the gate of a factory or
obstructing access to a building, etc.”27 Those who were critical of the tactic because companies had to expend resources
to defend their websites failed to understand the nature of
direct action. Direct action exceeds a liberal politics of publicity, speech, and debate, having the goal of directly halting
activity or impacting and inconveniencing the targeted party.28
DDoS fits the bill.
Of course, all of these arguments do not necessarily justify
DDoS in all situations. Rather, they more thoroughly demonstrate its pretzel-logic and ethical relationality. Internet scholar
Ethan Zuckerman and his coauthors have written persuasively
about how DDoS can truly harm small organizations lacking
the defensive resources of a large corporation.29 Even if one
supports its limited use (say, against well-resourced and powerful organizations), the proliferation of DDoS, critics charge,
still encourages the use of a tactic that can quickly devolve
into an arms race where those with more bandwidth can outmuscle those with less.
Whatever one might think of the utility and morality of the
tactic, we can gain additional perspective by considering the
actual technical and legal outcome of a typical DDoS attack.
This will also help us weigh the fairness (or lack thereof) of
the punishments meted out to participants. In spite of erroneous media reports, the servers that bear the brunt of DDoS
traffic are not hacked into—nor do they suffer any permanent
damage or data loss.30 Costs are incurred primarily because
targets need to hire firms to provide DDoS protection. A successful DDoS attack against a corporation blocks access to an
Internet domain. This may stall access to e-commerce, but it

does not affect an organization’s internal computer system.
The typical Anonymous DDoS attacks, or “traffic floods,”
were unsuccessful against service sites that perform a lot of
data transactions and are served by CDNs (Content Delivery
Networks) like Amazon.com. (AnonOps briefly tried to target
Amazon.com directly and it was a spectacular failure.) Even
with the estimated thousands of individuals contributing their
computers to a voluntary botnet, their efforts never shuttered infrastructural backbones like Amazon Web Services.
Anonymous’s DDoS campaigns tended to be more successful
against informational sites like mpaa.org. Anonymous’s digital
protest tactics essentially blocked access to these domains, but
only their Internet-facing websites.
Given what transpires during a DDoS attack, and whatever
one might think of the risks and seriousness of it, one thing
seems certain: the charges leveled against Anonymous participants in the US and the UK tend to be out of line with the
nonviolent nature of these actions. In the US, arrests for DDoS
attacks were made under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(CFAA), which tends to lead to harsher punishments as compared to charges brought under analogous offline statutes.
Offline protesting tactics such as trespassing or vandalism—
wherein damage is not merely speculative—rarely result in
catastrophic consequences for participants. Yet this nuance
that recognizes the intention and the consequences of actions
is rarely granted to online activities, especially when the CFAA
is invoked. As a result, similar behavior that might earn an
offender an infraction or misdemeanor offline (with a penalty
of perhaps thirty days in jail) is punished as a felony with
hefty fine and jail time when it takes place online.
To put this in perspective: in Wisconsin, a thirty-eightyear-old truck driver, Eric J. Rosol, was fined for running an
automated DDoS tool against the Koch Industries website for
sixty seconds. (As part of an Anonymous operation, he was
protesting the billionaire Koch brothers’ role in supporting
the Wisconsin governor’s effort to reduce the power of unions 
and public employees’ rights to engage in collective bargaining.) The actual financial losses were less than $5,000, but he
was slapped with a fine of $183,000—even though a far worse
physical crime, arson, would earn a fine of only $6,400 in the
same state.31 The fine represents the cost the Koch brothers
spent hiring a consulting firm prior to the campaign for advice
on mitigating the attack. In the UK, Chris Weatherhead—who
didn’t directly contribute to a DDoS campaign but ran the
Anonymous communication hub where the protests were
coordinated—received a whopping eighteen-month sentence,
“convicted on one count of conspiracy to impair the operation of computers.”32
The legal outcome for those arrested for the PayPal attacks
merits further discussion. Due to excellent legal help and a
plea bargain (still in the works), most of the thirteen defendants charged with DDoSing PayPal will be fined only a modest
$5,600 each and will evade jail time. Even though they will
be charged with felonies, the judge will likely wipe it off their
records if they comply with their probation. Two others will
likely go to jail for ninety days to avoid the felony charge,
and one defendant’s fate is undecided.33 (Final outcomes will
be delivered in December 2014.) Even though the punishments are less harsh than expected, the defendants were still
put through an expensive and draining three-year ordeal, and
with felonies hanging over their heads, many may have had
(and will likely continue to have) trouble landing jobs.
The whole affair is also marked by doublespeak that illustrates the flagrant hypocrisy of a single corporation, PayPal,
going after protesters who participated in Avenge Assange.
(MasterCard and Visa did not seek to prosecute.) In court,
PayPal’s lawyers estimated damages to be up to $5.5 million.34
Meanwhile, in other venues, corporate officials claimed either
that “PayPal was never down,” or that the attack only “slowed
down the company’s system, but to such a small extent that
it would have been imperceptible to customers.”35 This is a
perfect example of how corporate actors not only can continue
The Shot Heard Round the World 141
142 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
to voice their positions just fine through multiple channels,
but can also engage in hypocritical and contradictory doublespeak as they put defendants through a costly, time-consuming
legal process.
Eventually, the debate about DDoS became largely moot
within Anonymous. The tactic’s success became identified
with its ability to generate news headlines. This reliance on
an obsessively cycling news media would grant a very short
half-life to the visibility of actions like Avenge Assange.
Anonymous, no fool, saw this coming; ceasing the operation,
the group announced to the world in a poster that “we have,
at best, given them a black eye. The game has changed. When
the game changes, so too must our strategies.” From December
2010 on, DDoS, with all its moral conundrums left unsorted,
became one occasionally wielded weapon in an increasingly
diverse portfolio of tactics. Meanwhile, events began to stir
in the small country of Tunisia, and the actions of a couple of
hackers, one from AnonOps, set in motion events that would,
yet again, shift everything for the collective of collectives—
events as important as the birth of Chanology itself.
chapter 5
Anonymous Everywhere
As 2010 became 2011 and Operation Avenge Assange
waned, other operations on AnonOps waxed. It was
not that AnonOps was splintering, but rather that it
was flowering. This IRC network became the digital platform
du jour for Anonymous activists of different stripes to organize
their operations. By the end of January there were operations
and dedicated IRC channels for Italy, Ireland, Venezuela,
Brazil, Syria, Bahrain, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, along with
non-place-based operations like Operation Leakspin, an effort
to comb through the WikiLeaks diplomatic cables in search
of newsworthy information. Many of these endeavors were
small but nevertheless gave birth to vibrant regional nodes, the
most prominent being Italy, Brazil, and the Hispano-Anons.
(At the time of this writing, Anonymous Italy has leaked documents from the office of the governor of the Lombardy region,
declaring the politician to be “one big corrupted son of a gun”
and accusing him, among other things, of allowing criminals
who distribute child porn to launder their funds through a
Lombardy bank.1
) These geographical pockets have thrived
and grown into full-bodied communities. Although showing
no signs of slowing down, very few regional nodes have been
documented.2
Operation Tunisia seemed to erupt out of nowhere. It was 
144 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
only much later that I was informed about its precise conditions of its birth; even years later, its founder fumbled when
pressed for a precise explanation: “I don’t really know why it
worked,” he insisted during an interview. Two geeks, Slim and
Adnon (not his real pseudonym), living in different regions of
the world, acting independently but united in the belief that
they could make the world better, set their sights on Tunisia.
Slim Amamou, a Tunisian citizen in his thirties, was hoping
Anonymous would get involved in publicizing the troubles
roiling his country. A programmer and blogger, Amamou was
fascinated by Anonymous; he had given talks about the power
and draw of nonidentitarian politics. He described Anonymous
as the number zero: the all-powerful number, the non-number.
This was a fitting example for a young Arab man, given that it
was Arab mathematicians who popularized zero. Embodying
the idea of void and infinity, zero was long held in the West as
a heretical concept, only entering usage in mathematics and
philosophy during the intellectual, and political, ferment of
the Enlightenment. Zero—the ultimate placeholder, refusing a
concrete identity.
While Adnon, living on the other side of the Mediterranean
Sea, chose to be Anonymous, living a privileged life in a
quaint historic town in Europe without fear of government
repression, Amamou was backed into the corner of anonymity. Tunisia was under a regime of heavy censorship: in 2010,
this nation of just over ten million people scored 164 out
of 178 in Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Index
(an annual rating that measures press freedoms based on a
questionnaire filled out by non-governmental organizations,
journalists, jurists, academics, and human rights workers in
various countries). Like many Tunisians, Amamou used anticensorship circumvention tools to read news and get the word
out. The use of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs)
was “standard knowledge among the youth,” he said to me. In
Tunisia, geekdom was often spurred by necessity and the will
to survive. 
Soon Anonymous would come to symbolize the general
plight of Tunisians, said Amamou in an interview—an icon to
be adopted by the young urban hacker and rural commoner
alike because of the role Anonymous played in their country’s
revolt. Many knew Anonymous had been the grain of sand
that gave rise to the pearl of media attention absent at the
start of their revolution. It was a modest and safe contribution
to be sure, but still a vital one. On January 8, a week before
Ben Ali fell, Tunisian schoolchildren sitting in a courtyard paid
tribute to Anonymous by donning the mask.
Amamou, who was already active in the sphere of Internet
politics, did not always act anonymously. On May 21, 2010,
he was briefly detained by government henchmen for his role
in organizing a demonstration against web censorship, set to
take place the next day in front of the Information Ministry.
He was re-arrested on January 6 during the height of the protests. He explained, “I was interrogated for five days by state
security … It is a place where people get killed, you see, and I
believe—I am sure actually, I don’t believe—that I was saved by
Anonymous.” Anonymous participants from Tokyo to Europe
heard about his plight (it was circulated on Anonymous channels), leading to a flood of calls to the Tunisian government.
So Anonymous had long appealed to Amamou. As his
country inched closer to full-blown revolution, he wanted the
faceless collective closer. So he “summoned” Anonymous to
appear. He thought that if an operation took off, it would force
the world’s media to stop ignoring Tunisia. Although he called
for Anonymous, he was not naive: “Anonymous is not your
personal army” is a refrain which he knew well. “You cannot
control Anonymous,” he told me emphatically, castigating me
after I asked him what he would change about Anonymous if
he could. All you can do is hope they will arrive. Fortunately,
they did.
And it was due in part to Adnon, who was fifteen years
old when he first found Anonymous. Raised in Europe, his
family was very well-off—though you would never know it by
Anonymous Everywhere 145
146 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
hanging out with him. He was one of the first individuals from
AnonOps I met “afk” (“away from the keyboard,” in IRC parlance), a pleasure I have since enjoyed on multiple occasions.
Out of the entire bunch, he was the most unassuming. Kind,
calm, and contemplative, he first struck me as a “regular guy,”
but within twenty minutes of meeting him, I could see why
some of the older hackers were fondly protective of him.
Taking cover from the unyielding sun under the rustling
leaves of a tree on a hot summer day, our conversation mostly
involved Anonymous shoptalk. That meant roughly 30 percent
gossip, 20 percent conspiracy, and 50 percent welcomed
pedagogy about the innards of Anonymous. The transition
from online chatting to in-person conversation was seamless.
Just encountering someone from this realm, in the flesh, was
a relief.
He would complain about his boring and menial day job
(though wealthy, he was not spoiled) and would become more
excited when he recounted one of his many outdoor adventures involving biking or canoeing. Sometimes bored at school
and having spent a fair bit of time online, he joined AnonOps
in the fall of 2010 during the first phase of Operation Payback.
He recounted: “I got involved because I read some article
somewhere and thought, ‘oh man, dem hax are cool!’ Then
it was so much more than that.” Though far from being a
talented hacker, he was still technically proficient, one might
even say a quintessential geek.
As he sailed along in the Anonymous ship, he accrued new
skills: security protocols, and database and webserver management. But “the biggest things I learned,” he said, “were not
technical. Teamwork and organization are massive.” He was
one—among four I met—of those organizers and brokers essential to making Anonymous’s clock tick, a device which resembled
Dali’s gooey melting clocks more than a Swiss machine.
For much of the fall of 2010, Adnon was an avid spectator on
IRC, only occasionally chipping in on organizational matters.
But he chatted, especially with other channel operators such 
as joepie. Finally, late in December, Adnon pitched a proposal,
aided by those he had talked to for long hours. The proposal
forever altered the course of AnonOps.
His suggestion was simple: use Anonymous resources to publicize the plight of the Tunisians revolting, at the time, against
their president/dictator Ben Ali, who had been in power since
1987. In his own words: “We had this #anonnews channel
and there was like three of us as moderators … One of the
guys there who I think was Tunisian said something like ‘This
kid burnt himself about this and there’s a few people doing
some small protests. It would be cool to do something.’” The
Tunisian government had by then already blocked the diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, which created an enticing
and urgent bridge for a cohort of geeks.3
Some channel goers initially insisted it was “insane … to
take on a government.” Adnon let it go. A week later, on New
Year’s Eve, Adnon was on holiday with his family. With a blizzard roaring outside, he sneaked away and jumped online
from his hotel room. He pushed back against the naysayers, bolstered by a sense of righteousness—and also a dose
of misinformation and misunderstanding: “I, being oblivious
to the actual size of the ‘moralfag’ anons, assumed there were
thousands of active members and said, why not?” It is true
there were thousands during Operation Avenge Assange, but
the consistent number ran only in the hundreds, and those
working specifically on propaganda and technical matters
numbered even fewer, and were shrinking. But he kept pressing, and eventually enough were convinced:
<Adnon>: We just spammed the shit out of the link to the channel
#optunisia everywhere
<Adnon>: people were bored
<Adnon>: it was a crazy idea
Many joiners were still skeptical. As Quinn Norton reported for
Wired, many “didn’t think either the op or the revolution had a
Anonymous Everywhere 147
148 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
chance.”4
 But it turned out to be one of the group’s most stellar
operations, ushering in a transformation from Anonymous to
Anonymous Everywhere. No longer was the group bound to
Internet-y issues like censorship and file sharing.
A day or so after Adnon resurrected the proposal, he
received a private message (PM) on IRC from someone on
#internetfeds, offering their many services—web defacements,
DDoSing, hacks. Maybe this would be easier than he thought.
On January 2, 2011, at the dawn of a new year—always a sign
of hope—Anonymous published the following press release
inaugurating #OpTunisia, eventually translated into French,
Arabic, Spanish, and Italian:
A time for truth has come. A time for people to express themselves freely and to be heard from anywhere in the world.
The Tunisian government wants to control the present
with falsehoods and misinformation in order to impose the
future by keeping the truth hidden from its citizens. We will
not remain silent while this happens. Anonymous has heard
the claim for freedom of the Tunisian people. Anonymous
is willing to help the Tunisian people in this fight against
oppression. It will be done. It will be done.
This is a warning to the Tunisian government: attacks at
the freedom of speech and information of its citizens will
not be tolerated. Any organization involved in censorship
will be targeted and will not be released until the Tunisian
government hears the claim for freedom to its people. It’s on
the hands of the Tunisian government to stop this situation.
Free the net, and attacks will cease, keep on that attitude
and this will just be the beginning.
The Tiger Consumes Four Chickens a Day
But let’s back up to the onset of revolution itself. Mohamed
Bouazizi, Nawaat WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning all 
deserve thanks for its inception. In 2010, living under the Ben
Ali regime since 1989, scores of Tunisians were downtrodden,
living in deplorable conditions, and fearful as human rights
abuses—torture, censorship, and detentions—intensified in
the country. The country had not been party to any large-scale
protests for decades, and its many Western allies, including
the United States, singled Tunisia out as a model of political
and economic stability in an Arab region otherwise known for
strife and uncertainty.
So when revolution hit—and when the mainstream media
finally reported on it with substance—it came as a shock (for
Westerners, at least). The demonstrations led to one of the
quickest dictatorial downfalls in recent times, and spread as
a chain reaction across the region, becoming what is now
called the Arab and African Spring. Like so many revolutionary moments, hindsight reveals that there had been, in plain
view, enough despair to fuel a fire of defiance for weeks. All
that was missing was a match: in Tunisia, two presented
themselves.
First, on November 28, when WikiLeaks released its first
batch of 220 diplomatic cables, they made the shrewd decision to partner with local activist and media outfits around
the globe. One was in Tunisia: Nawaat WikiLeaks provided
them with Tunisia-specific cables. Three Nawaat members
translated the cables into French and published them under
the banner of TuniLeaks to coincide with WikiLeaks’ larger
public release of documents. Nawaat also worked with
foreign geeks and hackers to ensure that their website with
the cables remained online in the face of vigorous attempts by
the government to censor it.
The cables confirmed what was widely known but theretofore undocumented as fact: Ben Ali was rotten to the core,
his regime was mired in corruption, and his family lived in
opulence while the rest of the country struggled to meet its
daily needs. “The widely available proof of government corruption and hypocrisy based on an unstoppable flow of leaks
Anonymous Everywhere 149
150 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
was significant in fanning the flames of anger and agitation
among citizens throughout the region,” wrote Ibrahim Saleh,
an expert on Tunisian politics.5
Many Tunisians read these cables, duly noting the exact
number of chickens fed to a pet tiger, and the three types
of juices served at dinner—one of which was kiwi, hard to
procure in the country:
12. (S) The dinner included perhaps a dozen dishes, including fish, steak, turkey, octopus, fish couscous and much
more. The quantity was sufficient for a very large number
of guests. Before dinner a wide array of small dishes were
served, along with three different juices (including Kiwi
juice, not normally available here). After dinner, he served
ice cream and frozen yoghurt he brought in by plane from
Saint Tropez, along with blueberries and raspberries and
fresh fruit and chocolate cake.
13. (S) El Materi [Ben Ali’s son-in-law] has a large tiger
(“Pasha”) on his compound, living in a cage. He acquired
it when it was a few weeks old. The tiger consumes four
chickens a day. (Comment: The situation reminded the
Ambassador of Uday Hussein’s lion cage in Baghdad.) El
Materi had staff everywhere. There were at least a dozen
people, including a butler from Bangladesh and a nanny
from South Africa. (NB. This is extraordinarily rare in
Tunisia, and very expensive.)
19. (S) Most striking of all, however, was the opulence with
which El Materi and Nesrine live. Their home in Hammamet
was impressive, with the tiger adding to the impression of
“over the top.” Even more extravagant is their home still
under construction in Sidi Bou Said. That residence, from its
outward appearance, will be closer to a palace. It dominates
the Sidi Bou Said skyline from some vantage points and has
been the occasion of many private, critical comments. The
opulence with which El Materi and Nesrine live and their
behavior make clear why they and other members of Ben 
Ali’s family are disliked and even hated by some Tunisians.
The excesses of the Ben Ali family are growing.6
Second, on December 17, 2010, three weeks after Nawaat.org
released the translated cables, an unrelated act of desperation
ripped open the soul of the nation. Bouazizi—a young fruit
and vegetable seller—was accosted by the police, who seized
his unlicensed food cart and refused to return it even after
Bouazizi offered to pay the fine. His first attempt at retrieving his cart was a frustrating failure. Low-level government
officials refused to even talk to him. Doubly insulted and with
a family of eight to feed, he set himself on fire. Powerless and
voiceless in one moment, he became, in the next, impossible to
ignore: but at the terrible cost of his life.
Protests began in Sidi Bouzid, the city where Bouazizi
resided. Quickly they radiated out in every direction. Lives
were lost at the hand of the police, causing more people to
join in the protests. Takriz, an Internet-savvy group chartered
as a mailing list in 1999, worked to connect the rough-andtumble street youth to the Internet.7
 Though Takriz had no
direct connection with Anonymous, they were kindred spirits.
A network of a few thousand, Takriz generally refuses to
cooperate with journalists, bandies about obscenity as a shock
tactic, and proudly embraces anonymity. Its current Twitter
account reads: “Tunisian cyber think/fight tank & street resistance network since 1998. Free, True & Anonymous—Takrizo
Ergo Sum—We make revolutions!”8
Bouazizi passed away from his burns on January 4,
2011, and the next day an estimated five thousand mourners attended his funeral, many of them chanting, “Farewell,
Mohamed, we will avenge you. We weep for you today, we
will make those who caused your death weep.”9
 The next
day, 75 percent of the nation’s lawyers went on strike, calling
for an end to the crackdown.10 Tunisians from all walks of
life—teachers, union members, students—joined the fray.
Protests continued to spread and police violence escalated. By
Anonymous Everywhere 151
152 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
January 13, dozens of journalists, bloggers, and activists had
been arrested and over sixty protesters had been killed. By the
middle of the month, Ben Ali decreed a state of emergency,
but it was impossible to contain the fury. However, reading
the Western mainstream media at the time, one would have
barely known.
“After all, you do not have to wear a mask to do it”
The North American and European public first got word of the
protests from the publication of a brief Associated Press story
on the riots. The report was understandably lacking in detail,
as the revolts had just broken out. With each passing day, even
as the protests intensified, the reporting in the mainstream
Western media outlets, with a few minor exceptions, remained
tepid. On January 9, 2011 (with Anonymous already engaged
in Tunisia, acting as digital courier pigeons to get word and
videos out from the trenches to the public at large), the AP
published another story, picked up by newspapers like the
New York Times and the Globe and the Mail, parroting Ben
Ali’s position. “People taking part in the spate of unrest say
they are angry at a lack of jobs and investment, but officials
say the rioting is the work of a minority of extremists intent
on damaging the north African country.”11 Ben Ali would flee
less than a week later, on January 15, 2011.
As part of its campaign, Anonymous wrote the following
letter to journalists:
It has come to our attention that the ongoing riots in Tunisia
have by and large escaped the notice of reliable Western news
networks. It is the responsibility of the free and open press
to report what the censored press cannot. The public demonstrations, as well as the actions Anonymous has taken in
solidarity with the citizens of Tunisia, demand mainstream
coverage. 
The Tunisian government, led by President Ben Ali, has
shown an outrageous level of censorship, not only blocking
the websites of dissident bloggers, but also sites like Flickr
and any website or news source mentioning WikiLeaks. In
a show of blatant disregard for the guaranteed right of free
speech, over the past 24 hours Tunisian government officials have hacked email and Facebook accounts of anyone
who has taken actions labeled as “activism” (which may
be as “dangerous” as planning a protest, or as innocent as
commenting on a discussion board for a WikiLeaks related
group). Entire Facebook accounts have been commandeered
by the Tunisian government, who have even gone so far as
to change profile pictures to a pirate ship in a mockery of
those who stand for freedom of speech.
Anonymous, in turn, has launched DDoS attacks against
the websites of the Tunisian prime minister and his corrupt
government, the stock market, and the primary DNS server
of Tunisia—thus successfully bringing down many of the
websites ending in .tn. Additionally, we have taken steps to
ensure that Tunisians can connect anonymously to the internet, and access information that their government does not
want them to see.
There has been an almost complete absence of prominent coverage. We ask, why is a news source like AlJazeera
one of the few covering these earth shaking riots while the
rest remain quiet? The world is getting the impression that
unless western economic interests are involved, our media
does not care to report upon it.
Perhaps you didn’t know? Now that you do, you can help
us spread the news. After all, you do not have to wear a
mask to do it.
Sincerely,

“Dudes believe me the key of this is having no ego”
But Anonymous was doing more than pestering the mainstream media to do its job. By January 2, 2011, a technical
team on #internetfeds forsook their holidays to work nonstop.
Indeed, Adnon told me he barely slept for two weeks. In an
interview, he explained that the operation took a different
approach than Operation Payback and Avenge Assange:
<Adnon>: With Tunisia we had a plan
<Adnon>: We thought carefully about what to do and when in a
small group
<Adnon>: presented a list of options in a poll
<Adnon>: then took the result of the poll
<Adnon>: It was much less a big group decision than other ops
OpTunisia marked, both internally and externally, a sea
change. All throughout the fall, multiple secret cabals and
channels had populated Anonymous. Even Chanology had
to reckon with marblecake, a cabal of its very own. While
those in secret channels wielded technical power, and in many
respects called the shots, they were still beholden to those in
the public channel if they wanted to get things done. The angry
masses of the IRC body politic kept the cabals in check—a
message made clear when, earlier in the fall, the masses rose
up in a collective shitstorm at #command’s attempts to cease
DDoSing in response to the Pirate Party.
The managing of OpTunisia was different: from the beginning, a handful of smaller teams composed of hackers,
propaganda makers, and organizers led the operation and
never let go. It was not that this team-based model displaced
other mass modalities of organizing. There were other, simultaneous operations—some of which originated from the
public channels with no cabal involvement. And a public IRC
channel attached to OpTunisia existed, and played a valuable
role. 
On January 2, 2011, a hacker named “rubik” (not his real
pseudonym), who had been working on two private channels,
swooped in to announce that a Tunisian website had been
defaced (all pseudonyms have been changed):
<rubik>: http://www.pm.gov.tn/pm/index.php—defaced

A group of hackers had been hard at work, cooperating as a
team, for some time. Yet the majority of journalists couldn’t
resist the opportunity to pinpoint a “mastermind” or “leader,”
the architect ostensibly maneuvering everyone else. Ironically,
an Internet search for “Anonymous leader” will yield at least
four different names. Eventually, most journalists identified
Sabu and Topiary as the leaders, most likely because they erroneously conflated their robust public relations presence with
organizational (or dictatorial) control.13
Although many articles single out a “ringleader” or a “mastermind,” the exact nature of what this entails is left largely
unstated. The reader is left to use his or her own imagination—
perhaps envisioning an elite villain sitting on a high-backed
chair in some ice palace, stroking a cat on his lap as a deep
echoing laugh reverberates slowly through the chambers.
Adrian Chen surmised, based on leaked IRC logs, that “Sabu
plays the role of a leader, enforcing unit discipline while the
other members stand by.”14 And yet Chen himself belies this
Anonymous Everywhere 155
156 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
insight in the next breath by shifting attention to a related
hack performed without Sabu’s input by another group of
Anons. Analyzing a single log for evidence of a leader is about
as effective as extrapolating the entire plot of a movie from
a single still frame. Yet the Guardian’s Charles Arthur made
the same error, writing, “For some time after the UK arrests,
the only visibly active member of LulzSec remained its leader,
known online as Sabu, who would simultaneously deny that
he was its leader and then use phrases such as ‘my team.’”15
But broader context reveals that Sabu was simply referring to
the #pure-elite channel he created long ago, and described by
other LulzSec members as an IRC channel where friends of
LulzSec” could hang out.
As it turns out, hacker undertakings, especially within
Anonymous, tend to be dynamic and fluid, with multiple individuals or even groups working in concert. What holds true for
one operation may not for the next. Sometimes a particularly
obsessive hacker engenders, for a time, an organized collective
workflow. At other times, it is chaos and miscommunication.
Indeed, when I interviewed Jeremy Hammond in prison much
later, he bemoaned, “I wish we were more like RedHack, more
disciplined.” RedHack, a Turkey-based hacktivist group, has
a clear hierarchy, a leader, and a spokesperson—products,
each, of sixteen years of organizing and a shared devotion to
Marxist-Leninist tactics.
Maybe Anonymous could have achieved more had it had a
leader or a static hierarchy. Hackers tend to suffer from what
I like to call Geek Distraction Disorder (GDD). Without oversight, a hacker could easily wind up in a field, surrounded
by yaks, with a shaving razor in hand, wondering how he
got there (if you understand this reference, you are at risk!).
But it is equally probable that Anonymous achieved so much
precisely because there was no boss pointing to a fixed destination. Whatever the case, the work unfurled organically:
depending on who was on the channel, what each participant
could contribute, and this willingness, in a certain moment, 
to learn something new—the crucial ingredient of most any
successful hack.
OpTunisia illustrates this all so well. Imagine yourself
on IRC, an Anon witnessing the operation’s beginning. It is
January 2, 2011, and you are working directly with Tunisian
activists and hackers who are feeding you unvarnished information about a historic revolt. You are at home, sitting largely
still except for your fingers moving at the keyboard, but the
information you receive enables responses that can make a
direct difference in the event, just one step removed from the
people on the ground throwing Molotov cocktails. Your contributions won’t necessarily be significant, but they can’t be
overlooked. They are personally empowering, a mechanism of
solidarity, and, in some cases, perhaps even a real boon that
shields those on the ground from harm. All of this depends on
shifting, messy modes of cooperation—and sets the stage for
organizations to spring up around a particularly good idea,
and to fall apart at even a hint of disagreement and alternate
paths.
At this time there were two different and private IRC
channels that were active simultaneously, #opdeface and
#internetfeds. The latter is where the heavy technical lifting
was done, the former where organizers congregated. A gopher
shuttled news between them. Some hackers were in the know,
while others were continually arriving (all pseudonyms have
been changed):

<gibnut>: K-rad, thank you!
<gibnut>: time to own tunisia then ;)
On other channels, users suggested DDoS campaigns, but both
in Anonymous and out, there we are those who prided themselves on being “real” hackers and dismissed DDoS as lame (or
even detrimental to real hacks, as we will see in a moment).
Real hackers find exploits. People who just run LOIC are considered beneath the “hacker” moniker, mere “script kiddies,”
or “skiddies” for short. gibnut announces that he has an “zeroday,” which is much more powerful. A zero-day exploit, or
“oh day” as people sometimes jokingly call it, is a previously
unknown security vulnerability in a piece of software. It is
called a zero-day because it is unknown by the public—or the
software authors who could fix it—for zero days and counting. A zero day is gold; anyone who knows the zero day can
exploit it over and over until it is patched. The most coveted
zero days provide access to a computer or network, which is
why they are sold for high profit in a thriving black market.
Many, many governments participate in this ethically problematic market, including the US government, who, according
to technology reporter Joseph Menn, “has become the biggest
buyer in a burgeoning gray market where hackers and security firms sell tools for breaking into computers.”16 The US
government largely purchases zero-days from private firms
that “spend at least tens of millions of dollars a year just on
exploits.”17 Suffice it to say, gibnuts’s news was received with
excitement:
<gibnut>: lets see fuck loic, we’ll hurt them a different way
<p-ground>: oh yes please
<gibnut>: I have 0day local root exploit against openwebmail and
Tunisia’s NIC servers run it
<gibnut>: https://risala.ati.tn/cgi-bin/openwebmail/openwebmail.pl
<gibnut>: if we can get into that server we can root tunisias .tn tld
nameservers and control its entire internet space
<p-ground>: oshit
<gibnut>: redirect it all to wikileaks ;)
<p-ground>: shit just got real due to gibnut
With this zero day, gibnut is suggesting that they can compromise the domain name registrar in Tunisia (the NIC) and
control the entire Tunisian top-level domain (TLD) name
space. An example of a TLD is .com or .org. Each country has
its own TLD; Tunisia’s is “.tn.” If the Anons can compromise
this Tunisian registrar, they can redirect everyone who tries
to navigate to a website that ends in .tn to any server they
wish. gibnut lulzily suggests WikiLeaks. Although this particular exploit did not yield access (for unknown reasons), it
did succeed in spreading an anxious optimism throughout the
sidelines:18
<gibnut>: let me see if I can get in… brb [be right back]
<p-ground>: Arm the nuclear warheads guys.

Like many hackers, if they don’t know something, they go
teach themselves:
<K-rad>: know tht postgres bug?
<rubik>: yeah
<K-rad>: i did some reading on posgres and lurned me some DB
[database] so now i know how to inject it :D
<K-rad>: stand by for dump
K-rad went away for a while, clearly working hard, then came
back with some results. K-rad accessed a database with sixteen
hundred rows (and thus entries) and tried to crack the passwords. First apologizing—“sry guys jst taking time because
i’ve never done postgres SQL and im trying to write it in to a
script to make it faster as i do it”—he then realized that the
ongoing DDoS was what was causing the slowdown of the
password dump. He implored:
<K-rad>: Someone tell optunisia DO NOT DDOS 193.95.68.156 it’s
fucking up my dump
As this was a team effort, other hackers were simultaneously
trying to gain access through other potential security vulnerabilities. They realized that if they could get shell access, which
enables a lower-level access to the system, they could potentially get the private emails of the prime minister of Tunisia,
and then leak them. rubik managed to gain access but, unfortunately, found nothing but spam—but that didn’t stop the
“owning” process. To “own,” “0wn,” or “pwn” a server basically means that you have gained the top level of privileged
access and, from there on out, you have free rein to do whatever you like with it. You can read any file, write to any file,
change running processes, inject your own processes/malicious code, or, if you are so inclined, delete everything. You
are “root,” the full administrator of the machine, even though
you are nowhere physically near the machine itself. Inevitably, 
of course, the Anons defaced the site, but first they attempted
to score some emails:
<rubik>: I logged it but there’s nothing there
<K-rad>: brb guys im going to make a fresh tea :3

As the team prepared to deface the page, K-rad excitedly
declared that there was an old kernel installed. The kernel
is the core component of an operating system—the contact
point between the hardware and the software. An old kernel
usually means that there are some known exploits, so this is
almost always a good sign for someone wanting to compromise a machine:

duckie had just logged in to help. He was eventually booted
for lacking sufficient low-level hacking ability, but he was a
skilled organizer and broker, so for the time being he was
allowed into the channel. He had a rare knack for naming
operations and a rare level of insight into the ongoing changes
affecting AnonOps:

While #internetfeds was in hot pursuit of the private emails
of the Tunisian prime minister, there was another channel,
#opdeface, also hard at work. But even in the elite channel
that was #internetfeds, many were blind to the existence of
#opdeface. Meanwhile, the search for emails came up empty.
On #opdeface, rubik gave a technical rundown of the exploit
they had found on #internetfeds.
Some Tunisian Anons realized an exploit could work on
another target:

rubik continued to act as gopher between the two channels.
With work done for now, he gave props to one of the team
members (not Sabu, by the way). Another Anon quickly
berated this individual praise on ethical grounds, and K-rad
himself played the accomplishment down—a clear example of
the self-effacing values at work in Anonymous:

So there you have it: hackers at work. It is mundane, quintessential teamwork, but also awesome and hilarious, at least
for those involved. I only quoted from two channels, but the
work transpired across four different groups—maybe even
more, and also likely on a collaborative writing pad where
the press releases were written. And keep in mind that the
public OpTunisia channels, #propaganda and #command,
were doing something, whatever that might have been, at the
same time. Many Anons were corodinating through private
messaging as well.
In short, there were so many tentacles that the idea of a
leader calling the shots is laughable: not a hive (as Anonymous
sometimes calls itself), not a structureless mass, nor a structured hierarchy either—but some modality of all the above.
“Don’t worry, I’m anonymous too”
As we have seen clearly, individuals can stand out among the
rest for their abilities in any particular situation. In OpTunisia,
Anonymous Everywhere 165
166 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
K-rad was one of these standouts. But over time, individual
contributions bleed into each other, and the individual is submerged. However, keeping this in mind, we can nonetheless
see the value of viewing Anonymous from the opposite perspective: singling out a participant, and his or her important
hack, for the purposes of upending another persistent misconception. By showcasing tflow’s work on OpTunisia, and
considering it alongside that of Adnon and Amamou, it will
become apparent that the stereotype of the typical Anonymous
participant—white, middle class, libertarian, and politically
naive—is nowhere close to reality.
tflow (featured above under a different pseudonym) is a talented programmer who joined Anonymous in the fall of 2010 and
founded #internetfeds as the secret hacking wing of AnonOps.
For much of the autumn, tflow was #internetfeds’ keymaster,
testing and vetting invited hackers with three technical questions. One of AnonOps’ more prolific technical contributors,
tflow had the clever idea to write an anti-phishing script during
OpTunisia. Phishing is essentially any method that is used to
acquire personal and private details—usually login and password combinations or credit card information—by pretending
to be something or someone trustworthy. A common technique
is to send forged emails that appear to be coming from the
targets’ email provider’s help desk, or from their bank, urgently
asking you to reply with your username and password before
your account is closed. A more sophisticated version contains a
link which, when clicked, installs a keylogger or other type of
malware. People fall for phishing attacks at an alarming rate—
making it a particularly lucrative technique. One computer
science study of the technique concluded: “Experiments show
a success rate of over 70 percent for phishing attacks on social
networks.”19 So it is unsurprising that the Ben Ali regime was
using a phishing scam, involving a malicious script, to plunder
the usernames and passwords to the social media accounts of
Tunisian activists. tflow’s idea was to come up with an antidote,
a “remove Tunisian government phishing script.”
tflow’s script is a quintessential example of an “artful
hack”—given an elegant definition by Jude Milhon, better
known by her handle, St. Jude, she once said: “Hacking is
the clever circumvention of imposed limits, whether imposed
by your government, your IP server, your own personality.”20
tflow’s hack was not technically sophisticated; he wrote the
code in less than ten minutes and could have done so in thirty
seconds had he been more familiar with the underlying technology. It was clever simply because it identified a need and it
worked.
Before he could even whip up the short program, he first
had to get his hands on the offending script. To do so, he had
to find a Tunisian willing to give him remote computer access
using a piece of software called TeamViewer. In early January,
he reached out to a Tunisian activist (with the exception of
tflow, everyone’s pseudonym has been changed):
<tflow>: anont
<anont>: tflow, yes
<tflow>: anont, are you in tunisia?
<anont>: tflow, yes
<tflow>: can you come on teamviewer so we can locate the ip address
the phishing scripts are running on so we can hax them? :]
Of course, anontunisia asked the obvious question:
<anont>: tflow, how can I trust you ?
<shaka>: tflow is very trustworthy
<oggle>: tflow is a trusted member
<Aa>: anont, I think various people can vouch for tflow and I’ll be
one of them.
Since trust is really often just a matter of faith, tflow offered
the soundest advice (and one person resorted to a dumb and
offensive “joke”):

<tflow>: anont, you can see everything i’m doing on your screen, if
you don’t like it you can exit
<shaka>: tflow is old skool payback from the start
<k02>: trust tflow always after rape you he gives you candy!
anont responded:
<anont>: A, tflow, shaka, OK. pm me
tflow was now able to write the script. It, quite simply, changed
the functions in the government script so that they did nothing.
A day later, after the script had been written, thrown online,
and was in the process of being downloaded by the thousands,
tflow and anont convened again in private:
<tflow>: hey
<tflow>: still here?
<anont>: yes
<tflow>: come on teamviewer
<tflow>: i want to see if the script works
[…]
<anont>: good work! well done

<tflow>: did you also send the anti-phishing script?
<tflow>: ah
<anont>: yes
<anont>: don’t worry
<anont>: i’m anonymous too :D
anont, a journalist, remains anonymous, but I had the fortune
of eventually meeting tflow in London during July of 2013,
two years after, nearly to the day, his arrest by the British
Metropolitan Police. tflow pled guilty to one count of computer
misuse, admitting to conspiring to hack numerous British and
international organizations, including the Serious Organised
Crime Agency, 20th Century Fox, and News International.
Since he was a minor when caught, he got off with a light sentence of community service. It consisted, as he told me in an
interview, of “tagging clothes that people donated with price
tags, putting them out on the shopfloor, and redesigning the
shop window displays.”
I had not spent a whole lot of time talking to tflow, certainly
not privately. His name was a constant fixture on my screen
and on occasion we chatted, usually as part of a group conversation. Usually engaged in a mix of technical or philosophical
conversations, he was eloquent and sharp as a tack. He could
be a smart-ass, but not in a cruel way, and it was often in the
service of a broader insight. Take, for instance, the following
conversation from March 2011, on an IRC channel for journalists called “#reporter.” A journalist had just logged in for
the first time and asked:
<reporter799>: how does this work?
<reporter799>: I’m very new to this
<tflow>: magic

Though he was often around, it was difficult to geographically place him. He was obviously a native English speaker,
but that didn’t narrow things down much. It never crossed my
mind that he, like Adnon, might be a teenager. When he was
arrested on July 19, 2011, and revealed to be a sixteen-yearold, shock rippled through AnonOps. People were surprised
because his fellow hackers considered him to be one of the
smartest of the crew; teamwork does not preclude the assessment of capacities and skills.
Since tflow was a minor at the time of his arrest, authorities could not release his name, only his age. I am ashamed
to admit that when I found out he was British and sixteen,
a picture immediately popped into my mind. It was not as
off as the “nihilists, anarchists, activists, LulzSec, Anonymous, 
twentysomethings who haven’t talked to the opposite sex in
five or six years,” described by Michael Haydn, the ex-director
of the CIA and NSA, in reference to those who would come
to support Edward Snowden.21 What did come to mind was
a pale waif whose wealthy parents thoughtlessly shipped him
off to boarding school at a tender age.
As it turned out, once he was eighteen, tflow was revealed
to be Mustafa Al-Bassam, and pictures confirmed that he was
not pasty white. He moved to London from Iraq with his
family when he was six years old, fleeing Saddam Hussein. His
father is a doctor—a general practitioner—so they are financially middle class. But they live in a poor, immigrant-heavy
neighborhood in South London, and have more of a workingclass lifestyle; his parents, like many immigrant families, save
instead of spend. When I prodded him about his background,
he explained, somewhat uncomfortably: “We live in the
bottom 1 percent areas in the UK, economically and socially.”
My first meeting with him, in London, was—unlike my first
meeting with Adnon—tense and awkward, since we did not
have hundreds of hours of chatting to connect us. The disconnect was likely magnified by the fact he had been out of
the scene for a while—he had been banned from the Internet
for two years. Thankfully, the sun streaming in through the
skylight—the UK was undergoing a rare sunny spell—helped
soften the mood.
We continued our conversation online. A recurring topic
was the morality of the law, unsurprising given his personal
experiences with the justice system. One day we discussed
another young hacker, Aaron Swartz, ensnared by the
American legal system. (Swartz was a cofounder of reddit, one
of the most popular sites online.) Swartz, at the age of twentyfive, was facing decades in prison—thirty-five years—and up
to $1 million in fines for downloading a cache of academic
journal articles from JSTOR, the scholarly archive available
to anybody on MIT’s network.
Had he been found guilty, it is unlikely he would have been
Anonymous Everywhere 171
172 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
jailed for that long. But the number of charges and the potential years in jail were used by prosecutors to leverage him
into a plea bargain and accept a felony charge. What is even
more remarkable is that he did not “hack” JSTOR’s website
at all; nor was JSTOR even pursuing charges. Sure, MIT had
to expend some resources over the affair, but it was not in
any way seriously harmed. The main prosecutor, Stephen
Heymann, nevertheless had the audacity to compare “the
Internet pioneer to a rapist and suggested he had ‘systematically revictimized’ MIT by not taking a plea bargain,” as Ryan
Reily of the Huffington Post put it.22
Perhaps he could have been found guilty of trespassing—
he stashed a computer in a closet on campus and connected
it directly to the MIT system. On a few occasions, the MIT
network administrators had booted him from the network,
certainly trying to prevent him from downloading more than
a certain number of articles. But even if some of his actions
were illegal or broke rules, from a moral standpoint one could
say that the downloading of academic articles, many of them
researched and written using tax dollars, was wholly undeserving of a thirty-five-year sentence and a felony charge—not to
mention an expensive trial also paid for by taxpayers. Swartz,
forlorn and overwhelmed by the prosecution, ended his life on
January 6, 2013.
One day, while chatting to Al-Bassam about the case, I mentioned an article written by a professor, Hal Abelson, who
had chaired a committee investigating MIT’s role in the affair.
Abelson absolved MIT and described Swartz as “dangerously
naive about the reality of exercising [his technical] power, to
the extent that he destroyed himself.”23 Appalled, I responded
on a popular techblog: “The true naivety here was Abelson’s.
His failure to attribute any blame to the unfair, aggressive and
excessive federal prosecution, instead characterizing it merely
as ‘vigorous,’ was as appalling as using a descriptive word
that one should reserve for a workout.”24 Al-Bassam replied:
“‘Dangerously naive about the reality of exercising power, to 
the extent that he destroyed himself’ is a statement that should
be applied to the prosecution, not Aaron Swartz.”
Al-Bassam—tflow—had experienced firsthand the force
of the law knocking at his door, and did so after months of
engagement in direct action for causes he believed in. It is not
surprising that youthful sensibilities are the source of so much
creative political energy. Such energy can be harder to sustain
as one’s idealism bumps up against the horrific realities of the
problems plaguing our world, coinciding with the saddling
of more and more day-to-day responsibilities. But if youthful idealism makes someone proceed in attempts to tackle
the enormity of our problems, then we need more, not less,
youthful “naïveté.”
Smashing Stereotypes
Adnon, tflow, and Slim are three Anonymous activists.
Anonymous is not the white, middle-class, American boys’
club of everyone’s default imagination. Hard numbers are
impossible to come by, but those Anons I have met and those
unmasked by arrests are a motley bunch (incidentally, motley
refers to trickster clothing, the court jester’s multicolored
smock). If, in addition to these three men, we consider the
cohort of hackers Al-Bassam worked with in #internefeds (and
later, LulzSec) now known due to arrests, the heterogeneity
becomes more pronounced. Among their ranks was a Puerto
Rican living in towering public housing project of New York
(he was also an occasional drug dealer and a foster father to
his nieces); two Irish chemistry students, one whose radical
political views were influenced by a father who was a member
of the Irish Republican Army who had been jailed for six years;
a Scotsman, who for much of his time in Anonymous lived on
the remote Isle of Yell; and a twenty-five-year-old man, Kayla,
who served in the British military in Iraq and performed a
female gender online.

Something about the pseudonymous environment likely
helped cultivate this cosmopolitanism. By cloaking markers
of the self, like ethnicity, class, and age, all sorts of different
possibilities are opened up. Studies confirm that we tend to
seek those who are familiar (or similar to us)—and fellowship via shared identity is nothing to scoff at, nor eliminate.25
Nevertheless, it is also important to create and experiment
with spaces that mute markers of class, age, and background
to help form connections that might not otherwise be made. In
a way, it could be that self-defined membership in Anonymous
itself becomes enough of a shared identity to foster these
connections.
While we can showcase surprising examples of diversity
within Anonymous, this is not to say that heterogeneity is
not notably lacking. Particularly when it comes to gender:
Although Anonymous boasted key female participants and
organizers (like darr, featured earlier in this book, and a feisty
activist named Mercedes Haefer whose actions will soon be
examined in depth), the only “femanon” hacker in LulzSec
turned out to be a guy passing himself off as one—Kayla.
Anonymous mirrors the structural inequities prevalent
across the computer science world. While most of the STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields have narrowed the gender gap, computer science is not one of them.
Indeed, peak equity in college enrollment occurred more
than twenty years ago when 37 percent of undergraduate
computer science degrees awarded in 1985 went to women.
Today the number hovers around 20 percent.26 And while
numbers are harder to harvest for the hacking scene (given
the informal nature of many associations), all indicators point
to even lower rates of inclusion.27 In certain sectors, such as
free and open-source software, many projects have responded
with initiatives to increase diversity.28 But among law-breaking hackers, the only females I have met or heard about
are those who have switched genders, which is actually—
and perhaps, for many, surprisingly—more common than one 
might imagine. (Conversely, it bears noting that—whatever
the reason—females are more common among trolling communities.) Even though there are no formal studies on gender
and the hacker underground, the low numbers are likely the
combined result of structural forces, the legal riskiness of the
activity, and the insular, braggodocious boys’ club mentality
within the established community.29 Occasionally, hearing
constant belittling of female contributions from certain
Anons, I would find myself wondering, “Is this sexism or
just trolling?” knowing full well that the distinction is rarely
clear-cut.
Being specific about diversity and gender dynamics allows
for more interesting questions to be posed: Why, for instance,
are gender benders, queer hackers, and female trolls common
and openly accepted categories, but female participation in
technical circles remains low? Some identities become accepted
while others continue to be viewed with skepticism.
Dismantling the stereotypes also allows a greater appreciation of the motivations held by many of these participants. We
may disagree with the tactics—hacking, DDoSing, doxing—
but we should distinguish these tools and their significance
from the composition of Anonymous itself. Time and again I
witnessed participants acting with political conviction, and it
is likely some of them were political newcomers.
This becomes entirely lost if we understand Anonymous
through the gross fetish of stereotypes. Many journalists who
have interviewed me as an “expert academic” ask, in some
form or another, about “the kind of person who seems to get
into Anonymous.” Though it is not the answer anyone wants
to hear, I often say that there is no kind—except, again, that
many tend to be geeks and hackers. Those who identify as
being part of the Internet are diverse in background, interests,
and political sensibility. But behind the question, the asker
likely has something in mind: socially alienated, white, angry,
libertarian, American youth. And if we assume the default
hacker and geek is generally male, middle-class, libertarian,
Anonymous Everywhere 175
176 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
and white, then it is much easier to treat a hacker’s political
interventions as juvenile and suspect—arising from a baseline
of teenage angst, instead of the desire for politically conscientious action.

“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere
<Anonymous9>: There’s one thing which makes me a bit bittersweet
actually
<Anonymous9>: Biella is here for college research
<Anonymous9>: I can’t help feeling that as soon as she’s written her
thesis or whatever the project is, she’ll have no further reason to hang
out here :(
<Anonymous9>: I don’t think she realizes how much she’s contributed
to Anonymous
<Anonymous9>: Even if she doesn’t see herself as part of it necessarily
This 2011 chat log between a core Anonymous organizer
and reporter was given to me in 2013. Upon reading it,
a flood of emotions and memories washed over me.
It reminded me how the quintessential anthropological life
cycle—the alienation of initial entry, followed by the thrill
of finding your footing, and the painful end of extraction—
characterized my research on Anonymous. Anonymous9’s
prediction was right—following Operation Tunisia I became
intimately involved with Anonymous, and this entanglement
has waned over time, especially when I started to write this
book. Soon after reading this leaked conversation, I assured
Anonymous9, one of my closest Anonymous confidants, that
he would remain a friend even as I moved on to other research 
178 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
subjects (but only on the condition that he realizes that I am
no longer a college student).
Anonymous9’s statements also reminded me that it took
only the single month of January 2011 to graduate from a
confused outsider to a confused semi-insider. The transformation was underwritten by the hours I clocked for research: five
hours a day online—at least—every day of the week. I tuned
in to between seven and ten IRC channels at a time, observing and absorbing the comings and goings of Anonymous.
Additionally, I was spending roughly ten hours a week doing
interviews with the media about Anonymous. I spoke with
over one hundred fifty different reporters in two years. As a
result, I now hold the dubious distinction of teaching more
journalists about IRC than anyone else in the world.
Over time, the vertigo that came from wading through so
much data, day after day, was replaced by a sense of belonging. I began participating in discussions and became known,
and more-or-less accepted, in a number of the sub-communities and channels that were constantly popping up, like
mushrooms in a forest after a good rain. No longer lost in the
woods, I became part of the woods. Like all forests, danger
lurked in certain areas—but at least I became increasingly
aware of where the enchanting parts could be found as well. I
found that my home became the AnonOps IRC channel called
#reporter.
Settling into my new home was far from a smooth transition. No matter how many times I psyched myself up to say
something, speak up, introduce myself, like now, this very
moment—I always backed down. I was terrified to say anything for weeks, scared, quite simply, of being kicked out of
the channel and losing such an incredible opportunity. This
group of Anons, unlike those from Chanology, was fiercer and
rowdier. I had watched, in rapt attention, others get banned
from the channel for violating some codes of ethics that
weren’t so clear to me and also, even more terrifying, for no
other reason than the lulz.
It wasn’t until early January 2011 when I first spoke up.
And it wasn’t entirely voluntary. Seemingly out of the blue,
they noticed me. I had been observing safely, nobody paying
any attention to me, until suddenly it was as if the lidless eye
of Sauron had swiveled his gaze to my corner of the room,
melting the shadows I hid behind and bathing me in a fierce
beam of light. I was away from the computer getting some
food in the kitchen. When I came back, I found this on the
screen:
<Topiary>: Can anyone in here confirm biella?
<q>: i talked to her today but…
<m42>: you know her q?
<q>: if she would send me a DM on twitter, i could.
<m42>: “biella is away: I’m not here right now” and no @’s in any
of 7 channels…
<q>: yes, if she’s the biella from twitter, i talked to her before
<Topiary>: We may need to dispose of journalists from here in just a
bit.
<m42>: she can come back later
You have been kicked by q: (hi biella, could you DM me on twitter
please? Thanks!)
My heart pounded. I groaned. It sucks to get kicked off a
channel. It means you can no longer see what is happening and
you don’t know why you were summarily removed before you
could defend yourself. It is embarrassing—one has to wonder
what they say about you when you aren’t there—and you are
not sure if you are going to be allowed to return. You might
get “z-lined” or “q-lined,” actions that operators can take to
permanently ban your IP address from the entire server, which
would mean that I would get removed from all channels at
once. Thankfully, that is not what they had in mind. It turns
out that they didn’t ban me from reentering the channel. And
so ten minutes later, racked by anxiety, I logged back on:

<q>: yar, can only say good things about biella. just wanted to be sure

Phew. Come to think of it, it was more like
PHEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWW. It was a make-or-break
moment. Had they called me out as lame or untrustworthy, it would have spelled my end—or at least converted the
prospect of trust and access into a Herculean feat. Those on
#reporter held more authority than your average Joe or Jane
Anon. Their opinions counted.
Perhaps my painless acceptance bears further explanation. Recall that I was two years into researching Project
Chanology. While AnonOps’ political culture was distinct
from the anti-Scientology crusaders, there was enough of a
cultural connection so that when participants rummaged
through my work, it struck a familiar chord. From my video
lectures especially, it was not hard get a whiff of the degree
of sympathy I held toward Anonymous—enough at least to
determine that I enjoyed the lulz.
And I was not alone. There was a confederacy of about half a
dozen outsiders given extra access in exchange for functioning
as Anonymous media mouthpieces. A hacker turned reporter
named Steve Ragan dished out the most detailed and nuanced
technical articles relating to Anonymous for the Tech Herald.
A business writer for Forbes, Parmy Olson, churned out waves
of stories, eventually becoming LulzSec’s private reporter. Two
of its members, Sabu and Topiary, spilled their guts to her, even
admitting—almost unbelievably—to law breaking. Writing
for Wired.com, Quinn Norton’s long-form reporting shone
brightly during Occupy as Anonymous converged with the 99
percent. Filmmaker Brian Knappenberger spent over a year
tirelessly interviewing more than forty Anons on IRC, video
chat, and in person for a full-length documentary. (Brian and I
would eventually team up in a hunt to film Sabu, which failed
miserably.) Asher Wolf, geek lady extraordinaire, talked to
many Anons behind the scenes and managed, like no one else
could, to capture its esprit de corps in chunks of 140 characters or less on Twitter. Amber Lyon, then a reporter for CNN,
won special points for doing the most un-Internety thing of
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 181
182 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
any of us: she trekked across a remote mountain pass from
Washington State into British Columbia with the Anonymous
fugitive hacker Commander X (Christopher Doyon) as he fled
the United States to avoid prison.
Anonymous’s exchanges with media figures and researchers
are as contradictory and varied as the collective itself. Most
participants worked with journalists as respectfully and transparently as the clandestine nature of Anonymous allowed. The
primary goal, typically, was to gain publicity for their causes,
such as the turmoil in Tunisia, but they also sought, whenever
possible, to carefully manage their own image. On a few occasions, the goal was to troll particular journalists as well.
Image management or trolling was aided by some in-house
publicists adept at framing content toward both goals, who
populated #reporter alongside the reporters and outsiders like myself. Two in particular were known for speaking
to journalists with panache: Topiary, who was eventually
revealed to be eighteen-year-old Jake Davis from the remote
Scottish Shetland Islands (self-described on his Twitter bio as
a “simple prankster turned swank garden hedge”) and Barrett
Brown, a fair-skinned, honey-haired Texan whose home den
was strewn with books and a taxidermied bobcat posed as if
about to pounce off the wall. During OpTunisia, tflow had
invited Topiary into the inner sanctum, and he proved himself
so adroit at spinning lulz-fueled and delightful propaganda
that he remained a core member. After Brown wrote a short
article praising Anonymous, Gregg Housh (one of the original
members of marblecake) pulled him in.
Topiary and Barrett Brown were also AnonOps’ resident
tricksters—each with a distinctive brand of chicanery. Inspired
by twentieth-century avant-garde art pranksters the Dadaists
and the Situationists, Topiary found his knack in spinning 140
characters of brilliant nonsense and absurdist media manipulation. On the reporter channel, he would brag of exploits and
scheme aloud:
<Topiary>: I’ve done a voice interview with these before, they’re
good, they work through Skype
<Topiary>: I told ‘em we had over 9000 members and made them
lose the game, you should bel-air them
<Topiary>: Or something
<Topiary>: Anyway, just got done talking with some monstrous
homogay named Andy who’s writing up on our latest fax shenanigans
Topiary, who held the admiration of many Anons, was a
masked joker—adopting the pseudonymity almost unanimously deployed by his peers. His name was only revealed
upon arrest. On the other hand, I did not include Brown’s covert
nickname—because he did not have one. He was just Barrett
Brown—sometimes semi-naked, as you will see—but always
Barrett Brown. He assumed the role of Anonymous’s spokesperson in winter 2011 and held it until May, when waves of
critics nudged him to take a step away. He also played the part
of AnonOps’ court jester. Like any self-respecting trickster, he
enjoyed a really hot bubble bath while sipping (presumably
cheap) red wine. After announcing his plans on Twitter—
“Going to get red wine. Will have live bubble bath when I
return in 15 minutes”1
—spectators could log into Tinychat,
a live video chat service, and watch him half-submerged in
water as viewers lobbed offensive and trollish comments his
way, in this case, “rape jokes.”
Arriving with name in tow, he was informally booted with
name in tow for violating an originary rule of Anonymous
(hinted at by the name itself): drawing attention and fame to
one’s name is the ultimate taboo. Brown attempted to iconoclastically occupy a liminal—betwixt and between—zone/
status. He acted like an insider but never concealed himself.
He was tolerated for so long only because he poured significant work into both the network and the larger cause. A
journalist by training, he was adept at afflicting the powerful
with ironic, scathing parodic writing. In one Vanity Fair piece
praising the investigative journalist Michael Hastings (now
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 183
184 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
deceased), whose unflattering profile of US General Stanley
McChrystal in Rolling Stone led to the general’s downfall,
Brown mockingly suggested, “McChrystal would have been
better off talking to Thomas Friedman, who is so amusingly
naive that in 2001 he declared Vladimir Putin to be a force
for good for whom Americans all ought to be ‘rootin’,’ a term
he chose because it rhymes with Putin.”2
 Brown possessed
an excellent feel for media dynamics, and he freely offered
advice to other Anons. In an interview, one Anon who worked
on writing press releases put it this way: “It was Barrett who
told me about how to get the attention of journalists, how to
get [press releases] published, how to utilize the news cycle
and get the timing right and that sorta thing.” Eventually
through his antics, and the fact that he assumed the role of
flack, sat too uncomfortably with the dominant ethics at
work in Anonymous. AnonOps informally banished its own
court jester.
Not Tolerated: Personal Promotion
In the middle of December 2010, Washington Post reporter
Ian Shapira contacted me. I debriefed him about Anonymous’s
history and strongly encouraged him to pay a visit to IRC,
specifically #reporter, for the story he was working on. I am
not sure if he ever did, but on January 22, 2011, he published
a substantial article featuring a Washington-area AnonOps
participant:
He goes by the code name AnonSnapple to keep secret
the fact that he’s part of the Internet collective of cyberpranksters and activists called Anonymous. Few at his D.C.
private school know that the 17-year-old senior attends
Anonymous’s public protests, where he wears the movement’s signature face mask of a grinning, mustachioed Guy
Fawkes …
AnonSnapple, who lives near Bethesda with his mother,
a housewife, and father, an economist at the International
Monetary Fund, worries that investigators might link him to
last month’s DDOS attacks launched by some Anonymous
members against MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, which had
stopped processing payments to WikiLeaks. “A while ago,
the FBI did some raids on servers from Anons that were
involved in the attacks,” he said. “Even though I don’t do
them, I am still a part of them. I am still active on the same
chat rooms as people that [did] the DDOS [attacks] … I can
be easily linked to them.”3
On January 25, 2011, a few days after the article was published, I linked to it on #reporter. Before I did, it was business
as usual on the channel, busy with chatter. In minutes, they
devoured the piece. Then all hell broke loose. It went on for
about an hour on various different IRC channels, notably
#reporter and #lounge:
<shitstorm>: snapple seems to have done this on his own
<shitstorm>: eg a local interview
<biella>: i tried to get him on irc but i dont think he ever made it and
well it kinda shows
<shitstorm>: That interview is ridiculous, its more of an advert for
snapple
<shitstorm>: “namefagging”
<shitstorm>: I did this
<shitstorm>: I did that
<owen>: indeed
<q>: :/
<shitstorm>: That is retarded actually
<shitstorm>: Im kinda mad
<owen>: i will remove him
<owen>: everywhere
<shitstorm>: excellent
<owen>: self serving bullshit
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 185
186 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<shitstorm>: “He worries so much about being exposed“
<shitstorm>: THEN DONT GIVE AWAY ALL THOSE DETAILS
Watching the conversation cascading down my screen, I could
feel the seething contempt emanating from the words. It stung.
Although I understood the source of their anger, by then I had
worked with enough journalists to offer the following cautionary advice:
<biella>: before you kick em make sure that the journalist was not
twisitng anything (unless this is a pattern)
<owen>: im so tired of children who think this is some giant game
<q>: he must have twisted the whole thing
<biella>: but who knows, i just have had my words seriously seriously
seriously twisted
<q>: and i dont think ian would do that
<q>: he is a serious journalist
<owen>: that sounds exactly like snapple imo
<shitstorm>: I agree
<biella>: k, u all know best for sure
Although Anons at times worked earnestly with reports, they
also often tore or trolled journalists to pieces (yes, even “serious
journalists”). But this was not one such occasion. What pissed
people off most was how AnonSnapple who had incurred no
personal risk during any op was speaking on behalf of those
who had:
<owen>: he knows nothing
<owen>: he needs to gtfo [get the fuck out]
<owen>: isnt he one of yours, q?
<shitstorm>: AnonSnapple recently asked a teacher if he could submit
a time sheet of hours spent designing and passing out flyers for an
Anonymous rally in Dupont Circle.
<shitstorm>: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
<shitstorm>: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<shitstorm>: !set rage on
<owen>: i wanna know when he shows up please
<owen>: stupid little punk kids
<shitstorm>: nah im going to strangle him
<shitstorm>: as well
And strangling him was pretty much what happened next.
They summoned AnonSnapple to the channel:
<shitstorm>: my god Snapple
<shitstorm>: what is that
<shitstorm>: ?
<shitstorm>: Snapple that has to be the dumbest shit, more dumb
than cloldblood
<shitstorm>: coldblood*
<q>: now its on the floor.
<owen>: snapple
<owen>: talk now
<shitstorm>: Snapple
<shitstorm>: Snapple
<owen>: before i remove you from here
<shitstorm>: Snapple
<Nessuno>: snapples queir
<Nessuno>: quiet
<shitstorm>: cus he knows hes fucked
<Snapple>: hahahaa
<shitstorm>: ohai
<Snapple>: you believe half of that shit is true
<MTBC>: fuck he know he cused
<owen>: you think its funy?
<Nessuno>: in during shitstorm
<shitstorm>: Snapple, why wouldnt it be?
<owen>: so wait
<shitstorm>: it seems about spot on from what Ive heard and seen
<owen>: youre saying they lieD?
<owen>: I WILL BRING THEM HERE NOW
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 187
188 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Snapple>: Because I would never state where I live
<owen>: and we will see
<Snapple>: First of all
<Snapple>: and what my parents do
<shitstorm>: well you tell us you are in dc
<owen>: you would if you seek glory
<Snapple>: I live in DC
<shitstorm>: derp
<Snapple>: That’s all
<owen>: we all know where you live
<shitstorm>: ^

<owen>: you tell everyone

<shitstorm>: alright
shitstorm grabs the shotgun
<shitstorm>: owen, lets go shall we?
<Snapple>: *runs*
<shitstorm>: Master-IT bring the M16
MTBC steals the shotgun and shoots himself in the face
Snapple left the room (quit: Z:lined (dumbass)).
The rage against AnonSnapple ran so deep and so strong that
even the banning—usually an effective release mechanism—
did little to blow the dark clouds away. The Anons were still
fuming, expressing a deluge of insults—owen, for instance,
proclaimed that “in the meantime, snapple can concentrate on
his schoolwork instead of IRC tonight.” After I informed them
that I knew the reporter, I got put to work:
<biella>: owen, q, i know ian
<q>: it was in reporter
<q>: biella, could you help us out here?
<biella>: sure i could get him on or let him know he should get on q
Finally, on another channel, owen added some concluding
remarks:
<owen>: attempting to use all the work that so many have done for
your personal promtion is something i will not tolerate
<Nessuno>: owen speaks sense
<owen>: he was all ‘hey look at me but i didnt do anyhting’
<butts>: I can’t believe he told him all this
<owen>: fuck that
<owen>: i can
Insulting the Meat
I was dumbfounded. Sure, I was familiar with the prohibition against “namefagging”—attaching your identity to your
actions. The norm was so well established in Anonymous,
stretching back even to its pre-activist days, that it was rarely
broken, at least back then (though Barrett Brown would soon
be accused of similar behavior). So I had never seen the repercussions in real time. What made this all the more captivating
was that I finally got to witness a phenomenon I had only
previously read about in ethnographic accounts. Tactics for
enforcing the ideal of egalitarianism are common but vary
in morality across many cultures. They range from the life
ruining (such as being found to be a witch), to the relatively
mundane, but all are quite effective. One of my favorite examples comes from the !Kung people in Africa’s Kalahari Desert.
Among the !Kung, when hunters return to the village with an
enormous slab of meat they are not showered with praise, as
you might expect among a meat-loving tribe, but instead with
a slab of insults. The teasing helps keep egos in check:
“Say there is a bushman man who has been hunting. He
must not come home and announce like a braggard, ‘I have
killed a big one in the bush!’ He must first sit down in silence
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 189
190 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
until I or someone else comes up to his fire and asks, ‘What
did you see today?’ He replies quietly, ‘Ah, I’m no good for
hunting. I saw nothing at all [pause] just a little tiny tone.’
Then I smile to myself,” gaugo continued, “because I know
he has killed something big.
“In the morning we make up a party of four or five people
to cut up and carry the meat back to the camp. When we
arrive at the kill we examine it and cry out, ‘You mean to
say you have dragged us all the way out here to make us cart
home your pile of bones? Oh, if I had known it was this thin
I wouldn’t have come.’ Another one pipes up, ‘People, to
think I gave up a nice day in the shade for this. At home we
may be hungry, but at least we have cool water to drink.’”4
Moral leveling of this kind does not extinguish power relations, much less differences in abilities. Some individuals are
just better hunters than others. On IRC there are those, like
owen and shitstorm, who run the network and unmistakably command the authority to enforce norms by appeal to
technical power. Banning individuals on IRC after profusely
insulting them doesn’t engender a strict egalitarianism. It
simply functions to downplay and modulate power differentials. While among Anons it is acceptable to shower some
degree of praise, any perceived attempt at converting internal
status into external status is deemed unacceptable. The public,
individual persona must be kept out of the equation, in the
interest of collective fame.
Had AnonSnapple accomplished more—especially the
risky work of civil disobedience—I suspect he would have
been reprimanded without banishment. By claiming enough
responsibility to be profiled while simultaneously insulting the
risky tactics employed by others, AnonSnapple’s aggrandizing
was received as an affront of the highest order. By this time,
people were hyperaware of the legal risks (and only two days
later, arrests were made in the UK and warrants were issued in
the US in response to a recent DDoS campaign). AnonSnapple 
was judged to have acted out of an improper self-interest, and
the dozens of individuals logged onto #lounge watched the
extermination with popcorn in hand. But this wasn’t mere
entertainment. The drubbing served as a clear moral lesson
for the wider audience, one that they tacitly endorsed in their
silence or eventual agreement.
“The nerd scare”
Beginning the very day of Snapple’s banishment, my old
vertigo returned due to a remarkable flood of events pouring
in and out of AnonOps. For the next two weeks I was online
during every waking moment, watching Anonymous engage
in a historic revolution. In coming to terms with the first wave
of arrests to hit their network, they planned and executed
Anonymous’s most extraordinary act of revenge yet.
The day AnonSnapple had been unceremoniously summoned to Mount Olympus and ritually tossed away, Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton issued a response to the mounting populist upheaval in Egypt: “Our assessment is that the Egyptian
government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to
the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people.”5
Piggybacking on revolutionary ferment in Tunisia, Egyptians
rallied for most of January to demand Muhammad Hosni
El Sayed Mubarak, the dictator in power for three decades,
step down. Egyptian organizers had called for a day of rage
on the 25th, and throngs of protesters obliged. As the events
unfolded, the recently christened #OpEgypt public channel
was awash in excitement and horror (pseudonyms have been
changed):
<WebA18>: yes, they censor twitter in egypt

What had at first been a sporadic flicker of governmentinitiated communication disruptions became wholesale on
January 28. The Egyptian government shut the whole damn
Internet off.
In order to reestablish some connectivity, Anonymous
teamed up with another hacktivist crew, Telecomix. AnonOps
and Telecomix had demonstrated differences in the past.
Telecomix, opposed to DDoS tactics, would try to keep sites up
as Anonymous gummed up access. But if there is an urgent or
interesting enough problem to solve—like getting communications access to people in need—hackers can put aside major
differences to work together. A number of Anons contributed
to the Telecomix-led effort to figure out how old modems,
faxes, and phones could be used to connect circuitously to the
Internet. At the same time, Anonymous’s small technical elite,
which had coalesced during OpTunisia and formed a persistent IRC channel, continued in their hackscapades in support
of the Arab Spring.
As OpEgypt gained momentum against Mubarak’s government, Anonymous themselves came under threat. Two days
after Snapple’s banning and the historic day of Egyptian rage,
the following warning flashed on #reporter in big red letters:
<ew>: ATTENTION: Any of you anons that are from US or UK and
have been involved in Mastercard, Visa or BOA [Bank of America]
attacks, delete any data on your machine(s) that might link you to
them, right now!
On January 27, 2011, authorities rounded up and arrested
alleged participants in the UK, while in the US three FBI agents
issued forty warrants in connection with the December 2010

Anonymous9 critically assessed the first major state crackdowns against Anonymous with an incisive and soulful
lament about the hypocrisy of state power. Since that first
shoe dropped, over one hundred people have been arrested
across the globe, from Indonesia to the Dominican Republic
and from Cambodia to the United States. These arrests are
historically exceptional—a high-water mark in the history
of hacking. Never before have so many hackers and geeks
been rounded up around the globe for their political ideas
and actions in one cohesive push. Over the 1980s, 1990s, and
2000s, scores of hackers were arrested, but raids were more
sporadic and usually took one of two distinct forms (I am
excluding hackers arrested for purely criminal operations like
carding).6
 Either law enforcement sought out single hackers,
like Kevin Mitnick or Gary McKinnon, who were not hacking
for social change but for their own enjoyment, or authorities
raided underground hacker groups to shut them down and
close their meeting spots, such as bulletin board systems. The
most famous and largest of these raids was Operation Sundevil,
carried out across fourteen American cities on May 8, 1990,
when twenty-seven search warrants were executed and four
arrests made.7
 On occasion, as was the case with the young
Julian Assange, hackers wielding skills for broader political
goals faced criminal charges, but this style of intervention was
less common and arrests on these grounds were even more rare.
With Anonymous came the first large-scale hacktivist movement that spurred a multi-state coordinated and extensive
crackdown. It qualifies as what Graínne O’Neill, at the time
a National Lawyers Guild representative for many of those
arrested, aptly described as “the nerd scare.” 
Want to Take a Seat?
Having since met and interviewed individuals targeted in the
“nerd scare,” the version of events given by one particular
person, Mercedes Haefer, sticks in my mind. Haefer joined the
AnonOps network in November 2010, when she was nineteen,
and quickly rose to prominence due to her tart wit and intellect. Haefer is and was a linguistic force of nature—her mouth
can run circles around a drunken sailor looking for a fight. I
sat with her on a panel at the 2012 edition of DEF CON, the
largest hacker conference in the world. Before delving into
a serious and impassioned description of her involvement in
Anonymous, she demanded that the audience—composed
roughly of 99 percent males—show their tits or get the fuck
out (“Tits or gtfo” is a disparaging comment which, in some
online communities, follows any user’s self-identification
as female).
DEF CON is held in Las Vegas, where Haefer happens to
live. However, her apartment was far from the conference, so
I suggested that she crash in my hotel room, on one condition:
that inimitable troll, the troll’s troll, weev, was not allowed
anywhere near the room. He had made some flirtatious
overtures to her on Twitter and had been spotted at the conference—and while I was happy to spend time with him, and
in no way opposed to their pursuit of any mutual affections,
I could not bear the thought that a hideous troll love child
could be yanked out of the depths of hell due to an unholy
carnal meeting in my hotel room (too much responsibility and
not enough connections with exorcists).
She agreed and we plunged into many conversations in Las
Vegas, which continued later online. Knowing that she had
been party to one of the notorious raids that occurred in this
period, I asked her just what it felt like to have the FBI descend
upon you. It is worth conveying her story because having a
mental picture of what can transpire during such visits is handy
for negotiating a potential visit from law enforcement. Most
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 195

people I interviewed were ill-equipped to handle the sudden
and intimidating show of force; they spoke freely when they
should have stayed silent except to request a lawyer. As hacker
Emmanuel Goldstein put it during the infamous HOPE panel
on snitching, “People panic, people panic … and the authorities count on this. The authorities live for this kind of thing so
that they get as much information.” (Note that the following
account of the raid is largely anecdotal, and represents her side
of the story. But many crucial details match up with descriptions of events found in the FBI document known as a FD-302,
a summary of interviews that was later leaked to me.)
The FBI arrived at dawn. Haefer peacefully snorlaxed
away in her apartment in a working-class Las Vegas neighborhood, as five to eight agents approached quietly in the
winter desert dawn. (It was difficult for Haefer to remember
the exact number of agents, as she was disoriented. They “all
looked alike,” she said.) They broke the silence by pounding on the doorway. Though jolted from her slumber, she
was not scared—figuring simply that her father, who worked
odd hours, had forgotten his keys. She dragged herself out
the bed, shuffled to the front door wearing her jammies, and
was greeted with “a flashlight in my face, which at six in the
morning is offsetting for anyone.” The bewildering quality
of the situation was magnified by her realization that a pack
of rifle barrels also pointed her way.
She described how they led her out of the doorway and into
the walkway that cut through the complex, then began patting
her down. While performing a thorough search they asked
questions, seeking to confirm her identity. Early in the questioning, her mouth woke up and bit back. “It’s me fuckwit.
Piss off. I’m going inside. It’s cold.” With that formality taken
care of, they all headed to the warmth of her apartment.
An agent asked if she would like to sit down. She questioned
his sincerity and perceived his gesture as display of power.
“You don’t ask someone if they want to sit down in their own
house,” she explained to me. The assertion of power booted 
her into a wakeful realization: “These are not my friends. They
will not help me. They’re here for their jobs.”
They searched the house, snapped pictures of equipment,
confiscated her computer, and interrogated her. She had told
me she was a bit of a wiseass, the following story confirmed
it. As is official FBI protocol, two of the agents paired off for
the interview, one asking questions, the other scribbling the
answers.8
 She claims they asked about 4chan. At the time, she
thought to herself, “If you guys think this is about 4chan, then
you’re even more incompetent than I thought.” She told me
she began prattling on “about this thread I’d read about this
guy who was in love with his dog and wanted to get her pregnant so he went around getting samples and stirred them in
a cup and injected them into his penis and got her pregnant.”
She noted that “they stopped taking notes for that part,”
and—sure enough—there is no mention of 4chan in the
leaked account filed by the agents. But, given Haefer’s
chutzpah and adept mastery of the lulz, it is theoretically
possible—even plausible. And the quote’s exclusion may be
in keeping with their methodology—the FBI (understandably)
is not in the business of the lulz (much less documenting it).
Based on two additional documents I was also given (covering
interviews with two other Anons who were raided the same
day and eventually arrested), the genre combines long summaries of interviews that stick to factual statements with the
occasional direct quotation, while glossing over trivialities.
There is no trace of, much less reflection upon, the tone or
emotional tenor of the exchange.
And yet, in Haefer’s recounting of events for my benefit,
these small acts of defiance meant a lot. In that exchange,
law enforcement and Haefer applied very different criteria
when it came to valuing information, as one might expect.
Regardless of whether they were trolled, or aware of being
trolled, or cared in either case (or whether I was trolled),
the agents’ report sticks to matters of legal relevance.9
They wrote: “Haefer then asked the specific purpose of the
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 197
198 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
search and the interview. Special Agent (SP) X then stated
to Haefer that he believed she (Haefer) already knew the
reason why the FBI was searching her home and for the interview. She then responded they were there for “DDoSing and
vandalism.’”
Still, the report and Haefer’s account agree in many regards.
She was asked numerous times to “explain further,” and she
responded by touching on a range of topics: from her precise
involvement in activities, to broader reflections on the ethics
of DDoSing. At first the report recorded her stating she “was
not involved that much in either [vandalism or DDoS]” but
“after being told she was not being truthful” (indicated, they
told her, by evidence in the IRC logs) she admitted she had
full knowledge that her computer was involved in DDoSing
PayPal and helped others configure LOIC. She also gave them
all her usernames, which the report lists, but claimed not to
remember the names of chat rooms, operators, and servers
because there were too many of them (in other reports I read,
the interviewees had less difficulty with recall).
Her report, as well as the two others I had access to, attempt
to describe, to some limited degree, the political defenses
offered for engaging in DDoS campaigns. But the presentation
of this information was different coming from Haefer and the
report. For her part, she told me she was asked directly about
Assange. No such question was evident in the report, only the
following claim, which is nevertheless interesting: “She was
supportive of PayPal being a target of DoS because she didn’t
like that PayPal [sic] withheld Julian Assange’s account, was
money owed to Assange. She stressed she was not an Assange
fan, just upset at what PayPal had done.” This was in addition
to a detailed summary of her political defense:
Haefer agreed with what Anonymous is doing. When a store
or real-world business is doing something that is unacceptable it can be protested in front of the property. Since VISA
or Mastercard is online, they can’t be physically protested 
and therefore must be an online protests [sic], or in the form
of a DoS attack. Haefer described such protests as a “right.”
During our interview, she elaborated on what she meant by
“right”:
It was about rights. It wasn’t about supporting Assange. It
was about supporting freedom of speech and government
transparency. It was about telling the government that they
can’t just interfere in foreign court cases. It was about telling
the government that they work for us not the other way
around. And that even though I didn’t like Assange, I still
believed he had the right to freedom of speech and a fair
trial. And that if we only supported the rights of people we
liked, then they weren’t rights, they’re privileges. And that
privileges can be taken away. Rights can’t be taken away.
They can only be oppressed.
If it is routine for the FBI to show up at 6 am, it is also routine
for them to ask for cooperation; this can mean various things,
from providing information on the spot to becoming an
informant. Haefer claims she was asked (and this request was
in the two other full reports I read). She declined, or in her
own more vivid words to me, “I told them to fuck off.”
When the special agent left, Haefer felt that despite what
she had just told him, he still considered her a ruffian troll
instead of an activist. According to Mercedes, he handed over
his card and asked her to “please not go after his family.” “If
he still thought that was an issue, then he still didn’t understand the case,” she said. Since we don’t know his side of the
story, perhaps he was also cracking a very dry joke.
Reflecting back on the situation, Haefer, who, like so many
Anons, was caught off guard when the Feds came, concluded,
“If I got raided again, I probably wouldn’t tell them I did it.”
But she was still proud then, as she still is now, of her small
contribution to defending rights.

“How to Protest Intelligently”
Dozens of other individuals in the United States were interrogated in a similar fashion during roughly the same time period.
A few people shared stories with each other or on forums
soon after, but for the most part, no one had any insight into
what had transpired. All the while, Anonymous kept rolling
along with contributing to the hard work of ousting a regime.
Throngs of Egyptians were descending on Tahrir Square in
the first of the dynamic occupations that would eventually
occur in Spain, then North America, and, eventually, Europe.
The numbers were breathtaking. By January 31, the square
held a reported 250,000 people. But the hopeful excitement
was dampened by escalating violence. On the IRC channels,
a number of Egyptians requested that Anonymous attack
government and state-controlled media. They refused. Even
though some groups of Anons were actively DDoSing government websites—a move that irked Telecomix—the general
consensus, echoed in both IRC chats and publicly released
statements, was to never attack the press (all pseudonyms
have been changed):

As part of their endeavors, Anons from AnonOps, members
of marblecake, and Telecomix worked to make a stunningly
detailed and well-illustrated pamphlet called “How to Protest
Intelligently.”
By the end of the month, it was as if AnonOps was acting
more like a human rights advocacy group than a mass of lulzdrunk trolls. Its efforts tended away from unilateral actions
and toward infrastructural support that might enable citizens
to circumvent censors and evade electronic surveillance. They
sent a care package composed of security tools, tactical advice,
and encouragement, like this note, clarifying the limited role
social media plays in such uprisings, even if they are touted
by pundits as a “Twitter Revolution”: “This is *your* revolution. It will neither be Twittered nor televised or IRC’ed. You
*must* hit the streets or you *will* loose the fight.”
While many Anons were invigorated by their ability to
support the historic toppling of dictatorial regimes in the
Middle East, for others, there could be no clearer evidence
of the ascendancy of moralfaggotry. Indeed, by contributing to the Arab revolutions and their idealistic political ends,
Anonymous had so transformed itself that it seemed as if, like
AnonSnapple, the lulz had itself been banished. As it turns
out, this was not the case. As the revolutions raged overseas,
a small team of hackers took revenge against an American
security researcher and his firm, and the lulz returned with a
vengeance.
“Moralfaggotry” Everywhere 201
chapter 7
Revenge of the Lulz
S
ome basic features of the political culture emerging out of
anonymity are neither new nor difficult to grasp. Consider
the anonymous leak that revealed COINTELPRO, a systematic and illegal spying program leveled against the American
population. One Pennsylvanian night in 1971, a group calling
itself the “Citizens’ Commission to Investigate the FBI” forced
its way into an FBI field office with a crowbar. As millions
of Americans tuned into their radios to listen to Muhammad
Ali square off with Joe Frazier in an epic fifteen-round boxing
match, the activists emptied file cabinets of more than one
thousand documents. Those on the subject of political surveillance were leaked to the media and published in the March
1972 issue of WIN Magazine, a journal of the War Resisters
League, and COINTELPRO was revealed to the public for the
first time. The program was initiated in 1956 by FBI director J.
Edgar Hoover, and operated successfully until 1971.
COINTELPRO’s mandate was initially narrow: to disrupt
the internal operations of the Communist Party USA, which
Hoover believed to be under the direct influence of Russian
infiltrators. Very quickly, its scope expanded to include the
disruption of home-grown political activism of all varieties,
including radical, conservative, and even moderate liberal
efforts. One stated goal was to 
204 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
prevent the rise of a “messiah” who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement. Malcolm X
might have been such a “messiah”; he is the martyr of the
movement today. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael,
and Elijah Muhammed all aspire to this position … King
could be a very real contender for this position should he
abandon his supposed “obedience” to “white, liberal doctrines” (nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism.1
And, indeed, the documents provide clear evidence of the
elaborate steps the FBI took to monitor King in particular.
The illegal surveillance lasted for years, starting in the late
’50s when the program was first authorized by Hoover. When
King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on
Washington on August 28, 1963, William Cornelius Sullivan,
associate director of the FBI, wrote to Hoover, “We must mark
[King] now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of
Communism, the Negro and national security.” King was considered “an unprincipled man” who had a “weakness in his
character.” Sullivan wrote, “We will at the proper time when
it can be done without embarrassment to the Bureau, expose
King as an immoral opportunist who is not a sincere person
but is exploiting the racial situation for personal gain.” Soon
after King was named “Man of the Year” by Time magazine,
the FBI was illegally authorized to bug his hotel room; “trespass is involved,” they wrote. The resulting transcripts were
presented to Hoover, who responded, “They will destroy the
burrhead.” The bugs captured evidence of King’s marital infidelity, which excited Sullivan and Hoover, since the recordings
could be used to destroy the “animal.”2
 An excerpt from the
FBI letter sent to blackmail King evinces the ugly historical
truth that the US government terrorized one of the nation’s
most revered and peaceful civil rights crusaders:
King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know
what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it (this exact 
number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite
practical significance). You are done. There is but one way
out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal
fraudulent self is bared to the nation.3
The government similarly targeted many other groups:
Students for a Democratic Society, white supremacists,
branches of the feminist movement, the radical Puerto Rican
independence movement, and countless anti–Vietnam War
associations. Their aggressive and multi-pronged methods
included predatory infiltration strategies with the purpose
of sabotage: sustained, planned, and organized disruption of
political movements so as to stamp them out of existence. They
seeded misinformation, blackmailed activists, took them to
court over tax mishaps, and sometimes even resorted to direct
physical violence. Government agents’ reckless mandates saw
them feed the media false stories and forge correspondences in
the name of targeted groups. Some of the most lasting damage
came from agents planted in movements so deeply that their
disruptions completely eroded the kernels of trust these groups
were built upon. COINTELPRO agents fostered a climate of
fear and demoralization, draining the vitality of what had
been legitimate and deep reservoirs of political activity.
After the Citizens’ leaks hit the press, other interventions
followed, including the release of COINTELPRO documents
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request; NBC
reporter Carl Stern used these documents as the basis for his
award-winning reportage on the subject. Once the full extent
of 1973/1974 COINTELPRO’S tampering with legitimate,
legal, and even quite ordinary political dissent became known,
the public was outraged. In the chambers of the US government a small group of senators formed the Church Committee
in 1975. After investigation, their conclusion was unambiguous and resolute in indicting the program: “Many of the
techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society
even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity,
Revenge of the Lulz 205
206 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
but COINTELPRO went far beyond that … The Bureau
conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation” (emphasis my
own).4
 Numerous reforms followed, including limiting the FBI
directorship to a single ten-year term.
Soon after acquiring the files, the Citizens’ Commission sent
the leaks to the press along with a communiqué, which they
wanted published in all news stories covering the FBI documents. The communiqué explained their motives and goals:
We wish to make these documents more widely available so
that they can be used effectively by all who are working for
a more peaceful, just, and open society. Our purpose is not
just to correct the more gross violations of constitutional
rights by the FBI within the framework of its present goals
and organization. Nor is it to attack personally individual
informers, agents, or administrators. It is instead to contribute to the movement for fundamental constructive change in
our society, for as we said in our initial statement, “as long as
great economic and political power remains concentrated in
the hands of small cliques not subject to democratic control
and scrutiny, then repression, intimidation, and entrapment
are to be expected.”5
While their intentions were made public, the members themselves remained anonymous until January 2014, when a few
individuals stepped forward.6 To expose toxic tactics, these
activists broke the law and utilized anonymity to shield
themselves from consequences. This dramatic exposé did not
happen online; there were no Guy Fawkes masks, no boxes
were popped, no mail spools Pastebinned, and WikiLeaks
played no role. But the concept was the same: cloak identity
for protection and to deflect attention away from the messengers, and get the incriminating word out. Had it not been
for the Citizens’ Commission to Investigate the FBI stealing
documents tucked away in file cabinets and desk drawers,
COINTELPRO might have remained in operation, leaving an
even more sickening trail of destruction in its wake.
Let’s fast forward to February 5, 2011, when Anonymous
uncovered a corporate plot devised by Washington, DC–
based security firm HBGary Federal to spy on and disrupt
WikiLeaks. Given the digital nature of contemporary documents, there is no longer a need to leave the comfort of one’s
home, much less break into some office space, to access secret
documents. Working together on IRC, Anonymous hackers
penetrated the HBGary computer system and downloaded
seventy thousand company emails, along with other files that
included a PowerPoint presentation entitled “The WikiLeaks
Threat.” The tactics suggested therein are strikingly similar
to those practiced and perfected during COINTELPRO. The
presentation outlines a set of strategies the firm claimed could
be “deployed tomorrow”:
Revenge of the Lulz 207
They also proposed to identify and intimidate WikiLeaks
donors and smear the reputation of supporters and journalists like Glenn Greenwald. They explained that these people
were “established professionals that have a liberal bent, but
ultimately most of them if pushed will choose professional
preservation over cause, such is the mentality of most business
professionals.”
Palantir Potential Proactive Tactics
•  Feed the fuel between the feuding groups. Disinformation. Create
messages around actions to sabotage or discredit the opposing
organization. Submit fake documents and then call out the error.
•  Create concern over the security of the infrastructure. Create exposure
stories. If the process is believed to not be secure they are done.
•  Cyber attacks against the infrastructure to get data on document
submitters. This would kill the project. Since the servers are now in
Sweden and France putting a team together to get access is more
straightforward.
•  Media campaign to push the radical and reckless nature of wikileaks
activities. Sustained pressure. Does nothing for the fanatics, but creates
concern and doubt amongst moderates.
•  Search for leaks. Use social media to profile and identify risky behavior
of employees.
208 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Although Anonymous did illegally compromise the servers
to steal these docs, it is likely that the actions proposed in
the PowerPoint presentation, had they been carried out,
would have seen the breaking of even more laws. As Glenn
Greenwald explains: “Manufacturing and submitting fake
documents with the intent they be published likely constitutes
forgery and fraud. Threatening the careers of journalists and
activists in order to force them to be silent is possibly extortion … Attacking WikiLeaks’ computer infrastructure in an
attempt to compromise their sources undoubtedly violates
numerous cyber laws.”7
While “The WikiLeaks Threat” presentation is similar in
spirit to COINTELPRO, there are numerous important differences. HBGary is not a government intelligence agency—it
is a corporate firm that had concocted a plan for corporate
clients. HBGary Federal, working with two other security
companies, Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies,
was pitching the WikiLeaks sabotage proposal to Bank of
America through their legal representatives at the Hunton
and Williams law firm. Palantir and Berico, working together
under the name Team Themis (a reference to the ancient Greek
Titaness of divine order and justice), were hoping such pitches
would result in a lucrative contract. Assange had announced
on November 29, 2010, that he held documents revealing an
“ecosystem of corruption [that] could take down a bank or
two,” and Bank of America had reason to believe that it was
one of these banks. According to the New York Times, the
bank set to work, “scouring thousands of documents in the
event that they become public” and hiring outside security
and law firms “to help manage the review.”8
 Since Bank of
America was not named directly by Assange, its reaction had
the interesting effect of drawing attention to itself.
In the aftermath of the HBGary document leaks, Bank of
America denied knowledge of the Team Themis proposal,
describing it as “abhorrent,” even though it was certainly
intended for the eyes of one of its legal teams (Hunton and 
Williams never commented on the matter).9
 Ultimately, the
Team Themis scheme was never carried out—as a result,
perhaps, of the leak itself; such a scheme relied on illegal
tactics and could only be carried out if there was plausible
deniability to protect those involved from backlash.
Beyond any possible direct disruption, the content of the
corporate emails themselves provided Anonymous and others
interested in corporate security practices with a great deal of
insight. Corporate espionage and sabotage leveled against
workers, nonprofits, and activists is nothing new. Henry Ford
relied on an internal security unit headed by Harry Bennett
to intimidate workers attempting to unionize. A private security firm called the Pinkertons, established in 1850 and still
in service today, gained notoriety for infiltrating unions and
spying on workers for its corporate clients. In fact, this practice
is so common that it has been given a name: “labor spying.”
More recently, Walmart has come under fire after accusations of widespread surveillance against “shareholders, critics,
suppliers, the board of directors, and employees.”10
Today the private surveillance industry is a more profitable,
wide-ranging, and robust sector than ever before—boasting close ties to three-letter government agencies (indeed,
many contractors employ government- and military-trained
operatives). A 2013 report entitled Spooky Business, written
by the Center for Corporate Policy, a nonprofit seeking to
check corporate abuse, enumerates over a dozen examples of
corporate-led spying and infiltration—many using standard
COINTELPRO-style tactics—directed at antiwar, environmental, food safety, animal rights, and gun control groups,
among others. To take one example, the environmental group
Greenpeace has been subject to numerous illegal infiltrations—
Électricité de France, for instance, employed a firm to hack
Greenpeace France in 2006 and was fined 1.5 million euros
when the action was revealed.11
The report conveys the disturbing crux of the contemporary
problem of corporate infiltration as follows: “The corporate
Revenge of the Lulz 209
210 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
capacity for espionage has skyrocketed in recent years …
These current and former government employees, and current
government contractors, do their spying against nonprofits
with little regulation or oversight, and apparently with near
impunity.”12
HBGary’s specialized services, which offered “sophisticated” spy operations, was but a small player in a vast industry.
However, a team of tech-savvy journalists at Ars Technica, after
carefully sifting through the emails procured by Anonymous
and writing a dozen in-depth accounts (later compiled into
a book), ultimately concluded that the “WikiLeaks Threat
attack capability wasn’t mere bluster.” HBGary was on the
forefront of these types of services, having developed effective anti-malware software and custom trojans, rootkits, and
spyware which facilitated unauthorized access into computer
systems. HBGary had also stashed away a bundle of zero-day
exploits—those vulnerabilities that have not been publicly
disclosed—for future use, thus ensuring direct access to untold
numbers of networks, computers, and emails. According to
the leaked documents, HBGary provided a cache of these
zero-days, code-named Juicy Fruit, to a subdivision of military
contractor Northrop Grumman called Xetron.13
Public information about this market in zero-days was
nearly nonexistent until a series of investigative reports filed
between 2012 and 2014 revealed it as a thriving industry.
According to the New York Times, these exploits can sell from
$35,000 to $160,000 a piece. Governments pay the highest
prices, ensuring significant control of the vulnerabilities. The
US government, in particular, is considered a leading client.14
Exploits can be used defensively, but it is increasingly clear
they are often “weaponized and deployed aggressively for
everything from government spying and corporate espionage
to flat-out fraud,” as technology journalist Ryan Gallagher
has pointed out.15
While publicly available information about these practices is slowly growing, our understanding is still incomplete 
and fragmented. This work is mostly done or brokered by
corporations with laxer mandates and fewer disclosure obligations than their government counterparts. The HBGary and
HBGary Federal emails helped fill in the gaps, providing a
reminder of “how much of this work is carried out privately
and beyond the control of government agencies,” as Nate
Anderson concluded.16
It is important to note that those who exhumed this information were not, unlike the Citizens’ Commission that
uncovered COINTELPRO, looking for anything in particular.
The accidental nature of these contemporary discoveries is not
unique to Anonymous. According to Spooky Business, most of
what we know about corporate spying has “been uncovered
by accident, arising from brilliant strokes of luck.”17 However,
we might suggest that it was not luck at all, but instead a
welcome public good provided by the insatiable, boundless
curiosity of hacking—albeit spurred by external circumstances.
The HBGary emails, for instance, were procured through the
handiwork of hackers hell-bent on simple revenge.
“If we can get that level of information then
we really are the private CIA lol”
A week before his company was targeted by ruinous attacks,
the founder and CEO of HBGary, Greg Hoglund, praised his
team in a series of emails. After giving some instructions pertaining to the surveillance of a malware author, Hoglund ends
with a final boast:
Team,
Good work. Check out this site http://www.freelancesecurity.
com/ and find an investigator who can perform surveillance
and a positive ID on this person. I spoke with Penny and she
indicated she *might* be willing to support you guys hiring
out boots on the ground to get eyes on target. I would expect
Revenge of the Lulz 211

some photos, place of work, home, maybe some associates.
The site I mentioned is only one—there are a few others. If
we can get that level of information then we really are the
private CIA lol.

Though Hoglund envisioned his company as a sharper, meaner,
and leaner replacement for law enforcement and intelligence
agencies, in practice HBGary was mostly in the business of
developing anti-malware software and rootkits—stealthy
software tools that allow a user to access a computer system
undetected. But Aaron Barr, CEO of the subsidiary HBGary
Federal, which was created by HBGary to land lucrative government contracts, wanted to branch out into the field of
intelligence gathering. This was evident in the cocky title of
a talk slated for mid-February 2011 (but cancelled due to the
events in question) at a popular security conference in San
Francisco: “Who Needs NSA When We Have Social Media?”
Barr culled the data for his presentation by “infiltrating”
Anonymous. His method? For much of January, using the
handle CogAnon, he hung out on the AnonOps IRC channels
and correlated activity between the IRC channels and social
media. On IRC he would watch for someone posting a link,
and then he would turn to Twitter to see if the same link or
topic would appear at the same time, before deducing that
the IRC alias and Twitter profile were attached to the same
person. By the end of the month he had a list of nicknames,
real names, Twitter accounts, and locations of individuals he
claimed were the major Anonymous players. According to the
leaked emails, Barr’s aim was to expose key operatives:
From: Aaron Barr
Subject: Focus of presentation
To: Mark Trynor, Ted Vera
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2011 12:14:26 -0500
ok so I am giving a social media talk @ BSIDES SF next
month. I am going to focus on outing the major players of 
the anonymous group I think. Afterall—no secrets right? :)
We will see how far I get. I may focus on NSA a bit to just
so I can give all those freespeech nutjobs something. I just
called people advocating freespeech, nutjobs—I threw up in
my mouth a little. Man I find myself in a weird position.
In another email he insists to a programmer colleague—who
repeatedly questioned the reliability of Barr’s conclusions—
that “I will sell it,” referring to his docket of identities.19
(Eventually the coder was so concerned about Barr that he
wrote an email on February 5 with a prescient warning: “I feel
his arrogance is catching up to him again and that has never
ended well … for any of us.”)
Barr, on the other hand, thought his operation was going
swimmingly. So how did Anonymous get wind of Barr’s
infiltration in the first place? Unbelievably, Barr handed the
information to them on a silver platter by going public with
his project. HBGary’s PR department offered Joseph Menn
of the Financial Times a story about Barr’s upcoming talk. As
Menn explained to me, he “respected the work of the affiliated HBGary proper,” and “because Anonymous’s structure
and traceability was a topic of serious interest,” he decided to
move forward with immediate publication. On February 4,
2011, Anons woke up to these lines: “An international investigation into cyberactivists who attacked businesses hostile to
WikiLeaks is likely to yield arrests of senior members of the
group after they left clues to their real identities on Facebook
and in other electronic communications, it is claimed.” The
article also featured nicknames and conjectures as to where
these participants resided, which turned out to be off the mark:
A senior US member of Anonymous, using the online nickname Owen and evidently living in New York, appears to be
one of those targeted in recent legal investigations, according
to online communications uncovered by a private security
researcher … Mr Barr said Q and other key figures lived in
Revenge of the Lulz 213
214 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
California and that the hierarchy was fairly clear, with other
senior members in the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and
Australia.20
While Owen and q (lowercase) were prominent figures, Owen
lived in Toledo, Ohio, and q resided, more accurately, on the
European continent.
A feature story in a respected publication is a precious commodity. If HBGary Federal was really badass enough to identify
the movers and shakers behind Anonymous—before even the
FBI—corporate executives would, with good reason, be falling
over themselves to employ them. The firm’s finances were on
the rocks; a lucrative contract with Hunton and Williams
would mark a change of fortune.21 HBGary crowed about the
seemingly guaranteed meal ticket in internal exchanges:

We should post this on front page, throw out some tweets.
“HBGary Federal sets a new bar as private intelligence
agency.”—the pun on bar is intended lol.
—G
They were getting all the attention they wanted—only the
good kind, it seemed at first. The FBI contacted HBGary 
Federal the same day the story came out, requesting a meeting
for the following Monday morning at 11 am. But as comedian
Stephen Colbert memorably put it: “Anonymous is a hornet’s
nest, and Barr said, ‘I’m going to stick my penis in that thing.’”
Upon reading the Financial Times article, hackers who had
just completed the team-building exercise of “pwning” Middle
Eastern governments were ready to rumble. The article contained given names for many Anons—and after the recent
spate of Anonymous arrests in the UK and warrants in the
US, the matter was perceived as urgent. Sabu was the first to
suggest an attack, spurred in part by his deep-seated hostility
for white hat hackers and a security industry he regarded as
peddling snake oil: subpar security software. At first, some but
not all were on board. tflow later recounted:
<tflow>: i wasn’t initially [behind his idea], i thought it was a waste of
time and feeding the trolls
<tflow>: but then a few minutes later Sabu found a sqli vuln on the
hbgaryfederal.com site
<biella>: and the rest is history
<tflow>: yea
With a vulnerability too good to resist, the crew was all on
board, entering the HBGary systems right on the heels of the
Financial Times article. They downloaded scores of HBGary
and HBGary Federal emails, deleted untold numbers of files
and their backups, and, it is purported, wiped the data on
Barr’s iPhone and iPad. One of the first emails they came
across featured a PDF containing the unfiltered data Barr had
gathered on Anonymous. They quickly noticed innumerable
mistakes. Many of the named individuals had done nothing
illegal. Perhaps the most glaring problem was his ignorance
of the key operatives behind this very hack—tflow, Topiary,
Avunit, Kayla, and Sabu. Deep infiltration was unnecessary
to ascertain the existence of many of these participants, like
Topiary and tflow—publicly known and prominent members
Revenge of the Lulz 215
216 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
who spent time on open IRC channels, notably #reporter and
#lounge.
Using security scanning software designed to look for
known vulnerabilities, the hackers probed HBGary’s website
and quickly found a vulnerability in the custom-made CMS
(content management system). Peter Bright, a reporter from
Ars Technica who conducted a thorough accounting of the
technical details relating to the hack, wrote that “In fact, [the
HBGary system] had what can only be described as a pretty
gaping bug in it.”22 Once inside, they rummaged around and
found encrypted passwords. The encryption was too strong to
crack on their own, but by utilizing the brute force of a pool
of GPUs (graphics processing units) they were able to crack
the hashes in a number of hours.
One of the passwords, “kibafo33,” granted access to Barr’s
Gmail-hosted email account. There the Anons saw the jubilant
internal HBGary email exchanges. Naturally, the hackers tried
the password on all of Barr’s social media accounts and found
that he violated the first rule of informational security: never
use the same password across platforms. The team could now
commandeer all of Barr’s social media accounts for lulz and
worse. Getting in was just the beginning.
“Good drama must be drastic”23
It was Super Bowl Sunday, February 6, 2011. Millions of
Americans were glued to the tube watching overgrown bulky
men pounce on each other for the purpose of kicking a ball
through two goal posts. Aaron Barr might well have been one
of those Americans, but any such plans were overshadowed;
he had been brutally hacked. His Twitter account, hijacked,
spewed forth the most abject racist and degrading statements
possible in 140 characters, along with his social security
number and home address. Countless unflattering photoshopped images of Barr were circulated. His emails, including 
personal ones replete with embarrassing details of marital
troubles, were posted on the Pirate Bay.
In the midst of it all, he logged onto the AnonOps IRC
server and was invited to a dedicated #ophbgary channel. Barr
accepted:
CogAnon (~CogAnon@an-33E99D21.dc.dc.cox.net) has joined

<q>: Ohai CogAnon
<tflow>: Hello, Mr. Barr.
<Topiary>: Mr. Barr and his infiltration of Anonymous; “Now they’re
threatening us directly”, amirite?
<tflow>: I apologize for what’s about to happen to you and your
company.
<q>: Enjoying the Superbowl, I hope?
<CogAnon>: high one sec. please
<tflow>: I really do, Mr. Barr.
<tflow>: You have no idea what’s coming next.
<Topiary>: tflow, How are things going with that, anyway?
<Topiary>: CogAnon is clearly super 1337 with his PM psyops skills

<CogAnon>: ok…sure I figured something like this might happen.
<Topiary>: CogAnon, nah, you won’t like what’s coming next
<tflow>: CogAnon, can you guess what’s coming next?
<Topiary>: Ooh, a fun game - guess!
<CogAnon>: dude…you just don’t get it. it was research on social
media vulnerabilities…I was never going to release the names…

This brief visit on Sunday, February 6, was the preamble to
a more epic conversation that would take place later that
same day. The chat that followed has become one of the most
viewed IRC logs in history. IRC represents a zone of freedom
and autonomy on an Internet dominated by private interests.
When you gather dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people
together and give them license to say whatever they want as
Revenge of the Lulz 217
218 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
whoever they claim to be, it is only natural that humor, wit,
drama, and some chaos will follow. If the world’s a stage—
and all the geeks, hackers, and sleazy InfoSec hacks are merely
players—then what does that make the Internet? A play within
a play, written in real time, with each player contributing line
by line? They have their exits and their entrances but nothing
is known in advance. The output even looks like a screenplay.
The difference is that it is populist, participatory, and improvisational in character with real-world stakes and implications.
Act One
The play we are about to watch owes its existence in part to
Barrett Brown. Late Sunday evening he bought good tidings
in #ophbgary—a channel whose purpose was to discuss and
celebrate the hack:
<Laurelai>: BarrettBrown, you here?
<BarrettBrown>: I’m on the phone with president of HBGary
<Sneux>: lol
Sabu pitched the following suggestion:
<Sabu>: BarrettBrown, ask PENNY to come here and speak.
At this point, it was public knowledge that Anonymous had
been on a hacking spree against HBGary Federal and HBGary.
Sabu’s suggestion seemed like a taunt, not a real request. After
all that had unfolded, it didn’t seem plausible that Penny Leavy,
the president of HBGary, would plunge into the epicenter of
the rat’s nest currently at work clawing her company apart.
But that is exactly what she did. Sabu initiated the exchange
by reminding her of the uncomfortable facts:
<Sabu>: penny. before we get started—know that we have all [seen]
email communication between you and everyone in hbgary. so my 
first question would be why would you allow aaron to sell such
garbage under your company name?
<ComradeBush>: jesus cristo
<Sabu>: Penny, did you also know that aaron was peddling fake/
wrong/false information leading to the potential arrest of innocent
people[?]
She rose to Aaron Barr’s defense:
<Penny>: I did know he was doing research on social media and the
problem associated with it, the ease of pretending to be one of you
<Penny>: He was never planning on giving it to the gov’t. He was
never going to release names, just talk about handles
<Sabu>: Penny, if what you are saying is tr[u]e then why is Aaron
meeting with the FBI tomorrow morning at 11am? PLEASE KEEP IN
MIND WE HAVE ALL YOUR EMAILS.
<Sabu>: well penny like I said 4 times we have all the emails. theres
lots of emails from you promoting aaron’s research so … I’m curious
<heyguise>: im still seeding the emails
<Penny>: I think what he was doign was good, it was informative
and it will shed lite on lots of issues associated with social media
According to the leaked emails, there were no plans to reach
out to law enforcement, much less sell the data to them.
However, recall that Anonymous read an email exchange
where Barr had claimed point blank to his programmer, “I
will sell.” Anonymous devised an on-the-fly-IRC financial plan
of its own, a Robin Hood–esque blackmail proposal:
<Sabu>: penny. we will not target hbgary.com. its done. what you
can do is motivate your investment from hbgaryfederal over to
bradley mannings defense fund. and distance yourselves from aaron
barnetts’ research
<Agamemnon>: Penny … we are under fire in ways you do not
understand. Not just the feds … right wing ‘freedom’ fighters trying to
take us down … infiltrators have hurt us … Aarons research contains
Revenge of the Lulz 219
220 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
personal information of ppl who never did anything but show up here
… please try to understand our rage
Meanwhile, in Brown’s abode, the phone rang. On the other
end of the line was none other than Barr. They proceeded to
have a courteous eleven-minute exchange (Brown recorded
the conversation and subsequently uploaded it online). There
was some uncertainty regarding just what it was HBGary
intended to do with the data. Barr, whose voice bore no
trace of sourness, fear, or even anger, confidently introduced
himself: “I am a federal contractor working mostly in the
security space.” Anticipating a question about motives, Barr
claimed point blank, “I never planned to sell the data to the
FBI.” Again, the emails support Barr on this point—there is no
evidence that he had contacted the FBI. But he was certainly
seeking to profit in some manner by gathering these correlated names and “outing” Anons, as he put it—presumably
any number of embattled organizations would be interested
in ascertaining the identity of their assailants. Regardless of
the eventual outcome, the mere existence of such a file was
received as an ominous threat by the Anonymous community
at large.
To Brown, Barr presented a very different rationale, claiming
his overarching agenda was to demonstrate the weaknesses of
social media and expose the hierarchy behind the hive. “There
is definitely a structure,” he said. Brown assented to some
degree—“I agree a few dozen people set the pace”—but he
noted that many of the names were wrong. “I never purported
it was 100 percent accurate,” Barr insisted, even in his conversation with the Financial Times. “The reporter writes what he
wants to write.” Barr reminded Brown that he was still planning to meet with the FBI the following morning, noting that
“It is going to be out of my hands.”
Leaked emails indicate that Barr and his colleagues had,
indeed, given great thought—just that day—to the question
of releasing the names to the FBI. Ted Vera, the president and 
COO of HBGary Federal, finished off the chain in favor of
withholding:
You could end up accusing a wrong person. Or you could
further enrage the group. Or you could be wrong, and it
blows up in your face, and HBGary’s face, publicly. The hint
of you having their true names is enough. No need to release
names publicly. You meet with FBI tomorrow. I doubt they’ll
share much, but they may informally or inadvertently vet
some of your findings.
Anonymous, on the other hand, had no qualms and released
the document listing all the names.
As he had done with Leavy, Brown tried to lure Barr online.
“They would like you to come. I will try to keep things productive,” Brown told him. Barr, having already logged on
earlier in the day, resisted, and so Brown, in his Texan drawl,
switched strategies. “I understand you have had a rough day,”
Brown said. “You have been picked on. Again, it was not my
doing—though I can’t say I disapproved of it, because we are
here to protect ourselves and our interests here.” By the end of
the phone conversation, it remained unclear whether Barr was
convinced to return for a second round.
Off the phone and back on IRC, Brown, an avid gamer, proclaimed that he was done with “this silliness” and announced
his intention to “play some Fallout: New Vegas.” But first, as
Anonymous made successive demands, Brown offered a characteristic gesture of empathy toward Leavy:
<Penny>: Thanks everyone it was very nice talking to you. How do I
re-connect you?
<Sabu>: penny, can you have greg hop on your computer and talk to
us for a few minutes /?
<BarrettBrown>: If it makes you feel any better, I’m an opiate addict
and still on Suboxone maintanance
<BarrettBrown>: which I’m ending in a couple days
Revenge of the Lulz 221
222 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Penny>: Hey Sabu thanks for being so nice rough day
<Sabu>: its all good. rough day for us too
Act Two
As Penny exited the stage, Greg Hoglund entered, physically
replacing her at the computer:
Penny is now known as greg
<evilworks>: success
<q>: epic success
<greg>: SOrry guys it was me it was my computer and greg went
away
<greg>: he’s back
<Sabu>: ok
<Sabu>: GREG IS THAT YOU
<greg>: yea
Before Anons resumed their interrogation, they paused for a
self-congratulatory moment:
<`k>: Greg have you ever heard of ssh keys? [ssh keys referring to
encryption technology]
<Sabu>: first off, if you havent read already take a look at http://
pastie.org/1535735
<Sabu>: thats how we owned rootkit.com
<evilworks>: oh wow Sabu
<q>: that’s a good one
<q>: :)
<q>: what a security company you are
<Sabu>: is there anything you can do to stop him from using your
company name // hbgary ?
There was a noticeable pause as Greg looked at the paste site,
where a log of the leak was detailed. He quickly apprehended
the full seriousness of the situation:
<greg>: so you got my email spool too then
<Sabu>: yes greg.
<`k>: greg we got everything
<Agamemnon>: Greg, I’m curious to know if you understand what
we are about? Do you understand why we do what we do?
“We got everything.” Had this play been staged, Hoglund
would have, at this point, probably embarked on a soliloquy
bemoaning his fate—or, at minimum, conveyed some degree
of facial horror. Hoglund must have realized his options were
limited. But if you can’t trick the tricksters, one can always
appeal to reason … maybe?
<greg>: you realize that releasing my email spool will cause millions
in damages to HBGary?
<c0s>: greg, I do beleive the people around here are very honest
when they say they would be happy not to release it. But that they
will be basing that decision on what happens with Aaron.
<c0s>: which is why I asked you to possibl[y] explain your ideas on
what might be done there.
<c0s>: so they might have an idea of what you can do.
<Sabu>: greg, in essence we want you to distance yourself and
company from aaron
<BarrettBrown>: Like I said, great time to donate to Tunisia
<evilworks>: or Bradley manning
<evilworks>: whichever
Would his honest appeal work? With the reappearance of
another lead, we are ushered into the play’s final act.
Act Three
CogAnon entered the room.
<Sabu>: its aaron
<Sabu>: coganon
<Sabu>: thats his SPY NICK
Revenge of the Lulz 223
224 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Sabu>: hi aaron
<c0s>: Good evening Aaron.
Hoglund took a moment to dissociate himself from Barr:
<greg>: aaron is CEO of his own company, that unfortunately, shares
the HBGary name - I can’t do anything except yell at him on the phone
<`k>: hahaha they’re all here
<greg>: hbgary (my hbgary) has 15% ownership of hbgary federal,
for the record
<greg>: yeah, and aaron just had to poke the wasp nest didnt he
<evilworks>: i’m downloading some emails
Thanks to the emails, we know Hoglund’s claims here are
mostly hot air—Barr was a respected, central member of the
HBGary management team:
From: Greg Hoglund

Subject: Welcome Aaron Barr and Ted Vera to the HBGary
management team!
Date: 2009-11-23
I am extremely excited to announce that Aaron Barr and
Ted Vera have joined the HBGary team! Ted and Aaron will
operate and lead HBGary Federal, a wholly owned subsidiary
of HBGary, with a focus on contracting in the government
space. They are very experienced and most recently built a
$10 million/year business at Northrop Grumman. Both have
won and lead multi-million dollar development projects
and managed substantial teams. We have known Aaron and
Ted for more than 5 years. These two are A+ players in the
DoD contracting space and are able to “walk the halls” in
customer spaces. Some very big players made offers to Ted
and Aaron last week, and instead they chose HBGary. This
reflects extremely well on our company. “A” players attract
“A” players. Aaron will take position as CEO of HBGary 
Federal, and will be operating out of the DC area. Ted will
take position as President and COO of HBGary Federal, and
will be operating out of Colorado Springs. Welcome aboard!
—Greg Hoglund
CEO, HBGary, Inc.
Hoglund then changed tack, appealing to Anonymous’s supposed sense of self-preservation:
<greg>: do you guys realize that attacking a US company and stealing private data is something you have never done before?
<greg>: no, I think you might have considered your public reputation
- it doesn’t look good.
<Agamemnon>: Greg. Please answer: do you understand who we are
and why we do what we do?
<CogAnon>: I was never going to sell u have it wrong.
<evilworks>: we don’t CARE about reputation
<Sabu>: greg, our reputation is not at stake here. yours is.
<greg>: i mean this was a real hack - and btw, i have to concede you
really did hack us good
<evilworks>: we do what we think is right
<c0s>: Greg, and the people here dont care about reputation, at all
<evilworks>: there are numerous ways to make us look bad
<evilworks>: we dont care
[…]
<Baas>: Granted, you guys don’t do burn notices proper…But it’s
the thought that counts. We want Aaron’s reputation nuked for this.
<evilworks>: jesus
Brown, taking a break from his game, issued a reminder:
BarrettBrown: he’s still meeting with FBI at 11 tomorrow, remember
c0s: That is the thing that bothers me the most.
Sabu: he literally picked out random people from facebook and
connected it to irc nicks
BarrettBrown: and will no doubt discuss me personally

As anger erupted around him, Barr still did not concede:
<evilworks>: why did you start working on this anyway?
<BarrettBrown>: As I told him, my family was fucked by Feds
<evilworks>: was it personal interest, for research?
<CogAnon>: do u want me to answer?
<CogAnon>: guys it doesn’t matter anyways … you have released
my emails.
<evilworks>: i suspect its for monetary gain
<Sabu>: greg. please respond
<CogAnon>: I did this for research.
<CogAnon>: The fbi called me because of my research.
<CogAnon>: the email you are refering to about selling data was
about a model built on this type of research.
<c0s>: you knew, or your a complete idiot, you KNEW that your
methods were flawed.
<CogAnon>: The most data I was going to show was an org chart of
IRCs with icons representing those nicks I thought I knew …
<evilworks>: theres still some emails we havent released
<Sabu>: aaron, you need to apologize to us, your investers at hbgary
and set the record straight
<Sabu>: that you DID NOT identify anonymous leadership
<Sneux>: ^
<Sabu>: and that your research is purely academic and theoretical
With so much said, Barr had had enough:
<CogAnon>: ok guys I have to go to bed. I repeat this was only about
research on social media vulnerabilities … u guys crossed the line …
<c0s>: this was an eye for an eye by pepole you wronged.
<Sabu>: you did by doxing innocent fucking people
<Sabu>: fuck you forreal
<evilworks>: Fuck you ok?
<Sabu>: look at the names on your doc
<Agamemnon>: fuck it
<Baas>: The problem is that he doesn’t even consider that he did
something wrong.
<Sabu>: hes ok with doxing innocent people
<Sabu>: I MEAN HOLY SHIT
<Agamemnon>: Greg, make deal now … shut him up … all will be
well
<greg>: deal? what kind of deal?
<Agamemnon>: Aaron shuts the fuck up … your email stays private
<owen>: guys
<owen>: control yourselves
<CogAnon>: this was about research.
One of the benefits of watching an Internet play is that no
one knows what will happen next, and you can talk as much
as you want without disturbing anyone. By now, it was well
known that I was the resident anthropologist. An Anon sent
me a private message asking me to reflect on the moment:
<PKE>: so, what’s it like sitting in on all this?
<biella>: hi PKE
<PKE>: enjoying the view?
<biella>: mostly
<biella>: i am a bit sick right now so i am struggling with all views

<biella>: of anonymous?
<PKE>: well, thats a broad brush
<PKE>: i meant of their relentless takedown of hbgary and co
It was a bit of a struggle to keep up. I was in the midst of a nasty
flu and was worried it was the forerunner of full-blown rabies.
I had just had my last inoculation shot four days prior, after
an unfortunate run-in with a bat a month earlier. Through the
haze, the fever, and the sore throat, I offered:
<biella>: i was surprised at how quick it happened
<biella>: at first
<biella>: and then the conversation on the channel has been quite in
the spirit of the lulz
Revenge of the Lulz 227
228 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<biella>: which was perhaps submerged weeks before during the
other ops
To which PKE, spared from both the flu and irrational postulates about the onset of rabies, replied with a more incisive
commentary:
<PKE>: absolutely
<PKE>: i mean
<PKE>: great work was being accomplished
<PKE>: but there was a major deficit of lulz
<biella>: yep and now it has been restocked
<PKE>: i think this is more of a surplus
<biella>: haha true
<PKE>: i can’t think of a more ridiculous anonymous operation in
recent memory
<biella>: the conversation on the channel has been unreal
<biella>: the twitter feed was outrageous
<biella>: yep
<biella>: true
<PKE>: man. i really never understood the appeal of the internet hate
machine before this
<PKE>: boy, when you combine sociopaths with pissed off altruists,
get the fuck out of the way
In the end, left unsatisfied by what the mere mortals had to
offer, the Anonymous tricksters opted to release the additional
HBGary emails they had been holding onto for leverage. While
most of the company emails were being seeded for release
during the course of the chat conversation, the following week
Anonymous also released Greg Hoglund’s 27,606 emails on
AnonLeaks.24
A Team of Anonymous Ninjas Exposing Team Themis
For days following this epic showdown, the lulz pulsed
through the IRC chat channels, electrifying and recharging the
collective mood. The press could not get its fill of the hack.
Journalists sought out Barrett Brown for commentary, which
appeared from the New York Times to the BBC. On February
8, 2011, Brown jubilantly declared on #ophbgary:
<BarrettBrown>: NPR asked me who did HBGary
<BarrettBrown>: I told them “a team of Anonymous ninjas.”
<FEAR_Anonymous>: NPR?
<DingDong>: HAHA
<DingDong>: yes!
<FEAR_Anonymous>: LOL
<HateIRC>: lol nice
<Sci>: lmfao
From the outside, it appeared as if Brown was a beloved
Anonymous activist at the top of his game. But from the
inside, with just a tiny bit of poking, it was easy to witness the
grumblings about the role he adopted just a little too willingly.
At the time, Anonymous was fond of penning collectively
written documents. Most of them were about operations. One
appeared later in the same month bearing the title “All About
Barrett Brown. Add your comments guise.” This defacto performance review dissected his contributions—securing legal
help, writing editorials, getting the press online—in relation
to a moral evaluation of his public behavior. None of this
was done behind his back. Indeed, before the critiques were
issued he was solicited to write a statement, included here in
its entirety, to appear near the top of the document:
Yes. Anyone who doesn’t know what I’ve done for Anon
hasn’t been involved in OpTunisia and OpEgpyt to any real
extent, and anyone who wasn’t working on that campaign
Revenge of the Lulz 229
230 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
every fucking day can go fuck themselves. What’s fucked
up is how many more people are in this document than are
in any of Anon’s actual important documents. There’s my
“statement,” sweethearts. Also note that the person who
started all this did not get his paragraph put in the press
release and is upset aboutr it. —Barrett Brown
Understandably—given that he had just told everyone to
go fuck themselves—most of the following seven pages of
commentary hashing out his personality, motives, and contributions slanted toward the negative. The critiques, while
dotted with occasional positive assessments, found consensus
in opposition to his self-promotion:
—This is important. It’s about the basic principles of
Anonymous ideology, anonymity and the equality of all.
—You seem to imply that you are special and important
such that the principles mentioned below, anonymity and
equality of all, do not apply to you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Your dedication isn’t under discussion. You most certainly
are one of Anons most important friends. I just want to
say that I don’t want to see you as ‘leader of Anonymous’
nor spokesperson. I know that would be of no benefit to
Anonymous.+1 wholeheartedly +1 undoubtedly +1
*@Barrett: Anonymous will support you, as long as you do
not form a personal army and you abstain from leaderfagging. +1+1+1
The small team of hackers working behind the curtain were
also far from pleased by all the journalistic attention Brown
was receiving from the HBGary operation. Roughly a month
later, Gawker’s Adrian Chen and John Cook published an
article, “Inside Anonymous’s Secret War Room,” detailing
the aftermath of the HBGary hack. Brown had spoken to the
journalists at length:
Barrett Brown, who is generally regarded by Anonymous
members as a spokesman for the group, said he has known
about the “security breach” for some time: “We’re aware
of the security breach as other logs from ‘HQ’ have been
posted before (and I should note that HQ is not really HQ
anyway—you will note that the actual coordination of performed hacks will not appear in those logs).”25
Upon reading the article, many of the hackers, already annoyed
at Brown, became infuriated, lashing out at him on #anonleaks, the channel dedicated to discussing the HBGary leaks.
<tflow>: it’s ironic that you claim that you’re good at playing the
media yet you fail at making them get their basic facts right
Brown, along with Gregg Housh (c0s), who also frequently
spoke with the media, blamed the journalists for identifying a
spokesperson, even when instructed otherwise.
<c0s>: I had two people call today, and both said at the end of the
interviews
<c0s>: “can we call your official spokesperson”
<BarrettBrown>: here, listen to Housh
<c0s>: i have to fight hard each time to get the idiots to not do it
<c0s>: and some who agree not to
<c0s>: and completely understand
<c0s>: put it in right, then have editor fags “fix” it
<c0s>: and it says spokesperson, or something else stupid
<BarrettBrown>: there you go
<BarrettBrown>: argue with Housh
<c0s>: it fucking sucks dealing with these assholes
<c0s>: no
<c0s>: i dont argue heh
<tflow>: then go and get the editor fags to fix it
With that settled, they moved to other upsetting topics,
notably how Brown claimed insider knowledge about #HQ,
Revenge of the Lulz 231
232 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
the HBGary breach, and the hacking, when he had not witnessed the operation, much less contributed to it. Even worse,
he was simply wrong about #HQ; it was where the HBGary
hack was coordinated:
<`k>: tbh there’s no need for you to even be talking to media in
the first place you’ve done nothing yet you have an explanation for
everything
<BarrettBrown>: k, I’ve done some things, sweetheart
<tflow>: it also pisses me off how you make a statement to gawker
regarding #hq
<FriedSquid>: suggestion: being a journo is, to an extent, about
getting your message out there, exposure of your work. About
getting your name known.
<BarrettBrown>: can we stop talking about this?
<tflow>: when it doesn’t concern you in the least
<BarrettBrown>: they fucking asked me
[…]
<tflow>: then don’t open your mouth and tell them that it doesn’t
concern you if it doesn’t concern you
<BarrettBrown>: no, fuck you zomg
<`k>: it’s easy to say “no” to reporters
<BarrettBrown>: I don’t take orders
<tflow>: if you don’t know what you’re talking about
As was the case with Snapple before him, Brown got momentarily kicked off the channel, in this case by `k. This was
followed by final remarks, including a few about the quality of
the spectacle—as if the arguments doubled as an impromptu
version of a high school debating match:
<Earnest>: hate to be one sided but `k and tflow did a much better
job than barret on this occasion
<tflow>: I would have kicked him
<tflow>: but I don’t like kicking people
<tflow>: from chats
<`k>: im just sick of these faggots whoreing attention in the media
when they claim they have no part in things yet think they know
everything
Just as Brown became embattled due to his promotional activities in relation to the hacks, HBGary itself faced another set
of tough challenges and necessary decisions.
The Aftermath
A day after chatting with Anonymous and a week before the
premier North American security conference hosted by RSA
Security Inc. was slated to begin, Greg Hoglund bemoaned his
situation to a reporter: “They are causing me a great deal of
pain right now … What they’re doing right now is not hacktivism, it’s terrorism. They’ve really crossed a line here.”26 The
terrorism charge was new—never before appearing, either
publicly or in emails, from Hogland or Barr. The reversal of
terms was likely a carefully crafted PR tactic designed to paint
these hackers as “terrorists” and thus as a grave danger to
society; it was perhaps a calculated bid to convert the embarrassing reality of the gruesome hack—a potential (probable)
disaster—into an advantage. Hoglund also made the decision
to pull out of the RSA conference.
Though HBGary clearly hit a rough patch, the company
came out the other side of this turmoil unscathed, or perhaps
even stronger—aided by its rebranding of Anonymous as
a “terrorist” element to which it was victim. A year later,
HBGary was acquired by a defense contractor called ManTech
International. Hoglund cooperated closely with law enforcement in its investigations of Anonymous, as duly noted in an
FBI press release:
The broad case against six hackers, including [Hector
Xavier] Monsegur, [aka “Sabu”], is the product of an
Revenge of the Lulz 233
234 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
extensive investigation … The attack on HBGary was carefully investigated by the FBI in Sacramento and the case was
transferred to New York for Monsegur’s plea. Importantly,
the Sacramento investigation greatly benefited from the
assistance of HBGary itself.27
Aaron Barr and HBGary Federal fared less well. As CEO,
Barr could not be fired, but he elected to step down by the
end of February 2011, and the company subsequently folded.
During an interview with Forbes’ Parmy Olson, he reflected
on the events: “Do I regret [making those claims] now? Sure
… I’m getting personal threats from people, and I have two
kids. I have two four-year-old kids. Nothing is worth that.”28
The two other members of Team Themis, Berico and
Palantir, which had schemed with HBGary Federal to discredit
WikiLeaks, washed their hands of blood like Lady Macbeth,
immediately severing all ties with HBGary Federal and disavowing full knowledge of the plan. But as Nate Anderson
of Ars Technica put it: “both of the Team Themis leads at
these companies knew exactly what was being proposed
(such knowledge may not have run to the top). They saw
Barr’s e-mails, and they used his work. His ideas on attacking
WikiLeaks made it almost verbatim into a Palantir slide about
‘proactive tactics.’”29
In the aftermath, troubled by their new-found awareness
of such proposed tactics, a group of Democratic congress
members sought to investigate Team Themis. During an
interview, the lead congressman for the committee, Hank
Johnson, expressed why he supported the inquiry: American
tax dollars were being used to fund tools and programs to
spy on Americans and quell First Amendment rights.30 Other
congressmen, notably Representative Lamar Smith, quietly
dismantled and blocked this investigation. Regrettably,
the mainstream press never followed up to write about the
inquiry’s demise.
The growing dissatisfaction with Barrett Brown inside 
Anonymous did not slow him down. He remained active
within Anonymous for a few more months. The intimate
portal into a private security firm like HBGary Federal galvanized him and facilitated the establishment of his web-based
think tank ProjectPM (PPM), “a crowd-sourced wiki focused
on government intelligence contractors.” It was clear to him
that HBGary Federal was not an anomaly amongst defense
contractors. In an op-ed published in 2013, Brown expressed
his aims for PPM: “we must look not just toward the three
letter agencies that have routinely betrayed us in the past, but
also to the untold number of private intelligence contracting
firms that have sprung up lately in order to betray us in a more
efficient and market-oriented manner.”31
The ballooning size of this market-driven industry has been
thoughtfully assessed by Tim Shorrock, one of the few investigative journalists to extensively research the topic. Information
is scarce, as he explains, but there are a few telling details to
suggest the enormity of these operations:
Outsourcing has become so pervasive that the Director of
National Intelligence decided to study the phenomenon
last year. But when the report was finally completed in
April 2007, the results were apparently so stunning that
the DNI vetoed the idea of putting out a report and instead
told reporters that disclosure of the figures would damage
national security.32
It is estimated from current figures that 70 percent of America’s
$80 billion intelligence budget goes toward private contractors.33 While the HBGary and HBGary Federal emails provided
no hard numbers about the size of the overall industry, they
did offer qualitative measures that point to the massive scale
of the government intelligence contracting world. Brown,
aided by volunteers who did the bulk of the research and
writing, and all the technical work, hosted a central repository
to catalog the brave new world of corporations that specialize
Revenge of the Lulz 235
236 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
in intelligence gathering, espionage, and infiltration for corporate and government clients. Where the leaked documents
truly broke ground was in providing insight into the types
of tactics employed by private firms in the era of digital and
networked technologies; the firms were evidently willing to
propose and engage in reckless acts. After all, Barr was on the
path to providing actionable intelligence, for instance, doxing
some Anons who had done nothing illegal—even offering
nicknames and locations to a reporter. His firm had also laid
out detailed plans to sabotage the career of a journalist. Since
this type of work is now also spread across hundreds of different private firms, it is unlikely there will ever be a single
massive document dump equivalent to the one which busted
open COINTELPRO detailing the corporate face of spying;
instead, the public will have to rely on the piecemeal datasets
it receives through leaks and hacks such as the HBGary one.
Inspired by the success of the HBGary hack, other Anons
would soon seek to direct similar techniques to other security
and intelligence firms. But first, the hackers who had decimated HBGary Federal would break away from AnonOps
and embark on a fifty-day tour as an experimental performance troupe by the name of LulzSec. It would receive rave
reviews from Internet denizens. But corporations watched the
play, with its seemingly endless string of encores, in horror.
chapter 8
LulzSec
LulzSec—a crew of renegade Anonymous hackers who
broke away from Anonymous and doubled as traveling
minstrels—appeared a few months after the infamous
HBGary Federal hack. Crewed by the same individuals who
had vindictively hacked Aaron Barr, LulzSec’s startling fiftyday catalytic run began in early May 2011 and abruptly ended
on June 25, soon after one of their own, Sabu, was apprehended and flipped in less than twenty-four hours by the FBI.
Among their targets were Sony Music Entertainment Japan,
Sony Picture Entertainment, Sony BMG (Netherlands and
Belgium), PBS, the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the
US Senate, the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency, Bethesda
Softworks, AOL, and AT&T. Despite the avalanche of activity
—and numerous intrusions—LulzSec, when compared to
Anonymous, was more manageable and contained, at least
from an organizational perspective. Its members hacked with
impunity, finally making good on the 2007 Fox News claim
that Anonymous was comprised of “hackers on steroids.”
LulzSec members played their role knowing full well
they were performing for a diverse audience. Even the
haughtiest of security hackers who had earlier snubbed
Anonymous cheered on LulzSec. Some old-school black hats
lived vicariously through LulzSec, in awe of its swagger, its 
238 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
fuck-you-anything-goes attitude, and its bottomless appetite
for exposing the pathetic state of Internet security. Journalists
could not get enough of their antics, nor could they really keep
up. With so many intrusions, exfiltrations, and data dumps,
LulzSec blew out the usual three-day news cycle. For much
of its reign, LulzSec taunted journalists with the lure of information and then gave them the silent treatment—with one
notable exception: Parmy Olson of forbes.com. These hackers
(almost) exclusively fed her info about their dealings and, to
retain her privileges, she was discreet about the arrangement.1
Although they gave Parmy Olson enough information
to write her stories, LulzSec’s main gateways to the world
were their website, their Twitter account, and the website
pastebin.com, where all their dumps were mirrored and
their proclamations released. Pastebin is typically used by
programmers to post small snippets of text, source code, or
configuration information. It generates a unique URL that can
then be pasted elsewhere, like IRC, for others to view. Instead
of pasting multi-line text into IRC channels—something that
will get you kicked out of a channel for “flooding”—you can
simply provide the link. Typically, these generated links are
unmemorable random characters and expire after some time.
Pastebin is only one among a multitude of such sites, so why
LulzSec chose this medium is a bit of a mystery. Regardless,
it freed LulzSec from the need to host infrastructure for their
missives. Their Twitter account amassed followers in bulk,
sometimes twenty thousand per week. Penned by their resident
trickster, Topiary crafted delightful updates, often maintaining
a maritime character.
The LulzSec team was sailing the high seas—venturing
deep into international waters with a pirate flag hoisted high,
putting on a show for others to watch. During an interview I
conducted with David Mirza, a retired black hat, he observed:
LulzSec hit the Internet with a much more potent—and
instantly recognizable as authentic—black hat attitude than 
the fabric of Anonymous they jumped out of. They got it
right with the swagger and style. They were owning things
up, pulling dox, dispensing justice. Nobody could catch
them and they knew it. Their campaign became a great saga
that made some of those who’d lived that adventure before
feel like teenagers again.
With one tweet, the hacker zine and organization 2600 captured the general sentiment felt by the community at large:
“Hacked websites, corporate infiltration/scandal, IRC wars,
new hacker groups making global headlines—the 1990s are
back!”2
No respectable pirates can sail without a vessel, and
LulzSec’s crew helmed a boat christened “Louise.” The name
was provided by a reporter’s misreading—and resultant
mispronouncing—of LulzSec. And since the quarters were
infinitely spacious, they decided to bring along a mascot. The
classic pirate parrot was swapped for a colorful feline beast:
an affable gray cat named Nyan Cat who has been known,
among heavy Internet users, to brighten up even the drabbest gray sky by effusing, eternally, a stream of rainbows
straight out of its ass. This playful absurdity was tempered
by LulzSec’s virtual spokesman and logotype: a stick man
sporting a well-oiled, French-style, villainous mustache,
replete with monocle, top hat, and three-piece suit—and
sipping, naturally, a glass of fine wine. This refined gent
first appeared in a Spanish-language rage comic (a popular
meme-comic among Internet geeks), before being adopted by
LulzSec in March 2011. Fans referred to the unnamed character as being “like a sir”; eventually, he was known simply
as the “sir.” All of this added up to provide LulzSec with a
chimeric mixture of depth, mystique, and memetic mythology
previously unseen in Anonymous hacker groups. One Anon,
who had also been active in the black hat scene, put it this
way in an interview with me: “LulzSec seemed to have a sort
of fully formed mythos straight out of the gate while other
LulzSec 239
240 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
hacker groups like Cult of the Dead Cow took decades to
achieve that.”
Returning to reality for a moment—later we will explore
questions of fantasy—we should note that these hackers congregated on their own private IRC channel, where they were
shielded from the drama engulfing AnonOps at the time.
Unbound by the categorical imperative of moralfaggotry, they
could also hack whomever they pleased—for whatever whimsical reason took their fancy.
It may be surprising to hear that LulzSec sprang, fully
formed, from a single, unremarkable IRC conversation. It is
less surprising when one learns that these hackers were a bit
bored with Anonymous and—some of them, at least—had
grown tired of working on other people’s ops. Idle tricksters
will do anything necessary to end boredom. It also helped that
they had a cache of data stolen from Fox News just waiting to
be unloaded, and that AnonOps was, at that point, in increasing disarray.
Hell Hath No Fury Like Scorned Gamers
For most of March and April of 2011, AnonOps had not
slowed down from where we last left them, but the network
was plagued by a mounting litany of problems. Small fires
started to break out, and the wear and tear of putting them
out began to drag the group down.
Even if Anonymous’s crucifixion of Aaron Barr had turned
him into the 2011 laughing stock of the Internet, his mission to
seek out and reveal the legal identities of Anons did not die with
him. Backtrace Security (its name is a humorous reference to
an infamous 2010 Anonymous trollscapade against a preteen,
Jessi Slaughter, whose father claimed to have “backtracked”
Anonymous) made this end its singular purpose and pick up
where Barr left off. The organization’s most vocal member,
Jennifer Emick, had once been an Anonymous warrior herself 
during Project Chanology’s fight against Scientology, but grew
critical of the more questionable tactics subsequently used by
AnonOps (the very ones LulzSec would later seize upon as its
primary toolkit). A self-proclaimed fan of law and order, she
declared that “One cannot fight for justice and democracy by
using unjust, anti-democratic tactics.”3
 A good point, but one
which failed to account for the questionable ethics of her own
brand of vigilantism: in mid-March 2011, Backtrace released
a chart with the “identities” of seventy Anonymous participants and affiliates. As was the case in Barr’s attempt, many
of the names were either wrong or already public, all except
one. You have to give it to Backtrace. It was the one name that
mattered the most at that moment: Hector Xavier Monsegur,
the notorious hacker Sabu. (The Backtrace document had a
slightly misspelled version of Sabu’s last name: Montsegur.)
Backtrace did not dox Sabu through a feat of shrewd reconnaissance. They simply got lucky when one Anonymous
participant, who went by the name “Laurelai” and had spent
time on the more secretive channels, foolishly handed Emick
her chat logs. The slab of text—over two hundred pages of
logs—included a single clue leading straight to the Nuyorican
living in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. While chatting with
his compatriots, Sabu had accidentally typed out or pasted
a web address which included the domain of his personal
server: prvt.org. Once Backtrace plugged this web address
into Google, they discovered one of his sub-domains, which
included other personal data, which, inevitably, funneled
down to his Facebook page.
The Backtrace document, named “Namshub” (Sumerian
for “incantation”) was dissected to pieces by Anonymous,
but most people, of course, could only realistically assess the
veracity of their own outing. Sabu—and perhaps a few of his
closest hacking associates from days long past—knew he had
been exposed. By doxing him, Backtrace acted as the force of
Eshu, the trickster of crossroads, plopping the powerful figure
down at the crossroads. Sabu/Monsegur had a big decision
LulzSec 241
242 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
to make. Upon seeing his name, he could have wiped everything from his computer, gone dark, and returned years later
as a hacker hero. It is true that he could not have vanished
right away. Doing so would have made “it obvious that he
got doxed,” as tflow reminded me. But he could have left a
month later after accusations had died down. He was already
larger than life, and in his absence his prominence would only
have grown. In the words of one Anon, he was “legend.” Had
Monsegur opted to vanish for a period and reemerge after the
statute of limitations expired, he could have returned to his
beloved isla del encanto (Puerto Rico), safe to entertain his
friends and family with tales of his exploits. Calling it quits
would have been the smart thing to do, but Sabu was not
short on hubris.
Instead, he sought out Emick and bombarded her with
false information to seed confusion; one of his hacker mates
explained that “when Backtrace released their dox table he
tried to trick them into thinking he was a double agent working
for an ISP trying to infilitrate Anon, but they didn’t buy it.”
Although Sabu was well known among his peers, he generally kept a low public profile, until being doxed by Backtrace.
Soon after he tweeted for the first time:
hai! I go by the name of Sabu these days. I made this account to clear
some things up, especially after the leaks by #backtraceinsecurity.
He continued to saunter down Trickster Lane, even more
public than before, convinced he was untouchable, until he
was ultimately outed as an informant a year later. (Then upon
his release from prison, Sabu would be reborn as the scourge
of Anonymous. The day of his outing, a formerly close hacker
compatriot declared with no reservations on IRC: “its better
500y of prison than look yourself on the mirror and know
u suck.”)
I asked a few of the hackers how they responded to doxing
attempts like Namshub. One of the few core LulzSec hackers 
who was never identified or nabbed provided a four-part
rationale, which aligned with sentiments I had seen expressed
by others:
<Avunit>: A) You trust others [to] protect themselves enough so it
doesn’t matter
<Avunit>: B) Everything is going well and you want to stick together
because it works
<Avunit>: C) You don’t care about the names
<Avunit>: D) It could still be the wrong name, right?
On April 1, 2012, shortly after Backtrace’s viperous Namshub
doxing, AnonOps rolled out Operation Sony. “Prepare for
the biggest attack you have ever witnessed, Anonymous
style,” declared one video.4
 They began overwhelming Sony’s
PlayStation Network with a wallop of a DDoS campaign, disrupting the service and the gamers who used it. To understand
why AnonOps launched this attack, we need to backpedal to
January 2011, when Sony sued a boisterous and precocious
American hacker named George Hotz, better known by his
handle, “geohot.” His hacking specialty is what is called “jailbreaking”—freeing consumer devices like iPhones and gaming
consoles from their proprietor’s grip so they can be modified
as an owner desires. Usually, this involves some clever analysis
of the device, the writing of software that disables copy and
access controls, and the release of documentation for the whole
process so others can follow suit. This type of hacking converts single-purposed devices back to the preferable state of
a general-purpose computer. Although a single-purpose device
is useful for people who do not want to deal with complexity,
many technologists see this confinement as an arbitrary abridgment of their fundamental right to use their property as they
choose. They also see jailbreaking as an appealing challenge, as
if the company created a special puzzle for them to solve.
Hotz first earned the accolades of hackers and some digital
rights advocates in 2007 as the first hacker, at the age of
LulzSec 243
244 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
seventeen, to carrier unlock the iPhone. Then, in late 2009,
he put Sony’s popular PlayStation 3 (PS3) on his technical
agenda. Hotz and an anonymous team called “fail0verflow”
(unassociated with Anonymous) managed to break the lock
in just five weeks. On January 26, 2011, he spread the love by
posting jailbreaking instructions for the PS3 on his website,
bringing waves of attention to himself. Jailbreaking the PS3
allows the owner of the game console to do a number of
things one could not do on a normal PS3: play pirated games,
perform backups, play games directly from the hard drive
(vastly speeding up the loading time), play videos, install
GNU/Linux, and, perhaps most importantly, create, innovate,
and learn in a multitude of ways. When interviewed about
this feat by the BBC, Hotz rephrased a classic hacker motto
into his own words: “[PS3] is supposed to be unhackable, but
nothing is unhackable.”
Of course, corporations have mottos of their own—one of
which might be formulated as: “You hack, we sue.” Soon after
Hotz released the jailbreaking instructions, Sony sued him for
copyright infringement and violation of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act. Known for speaking his mind, Hotz did not
take the news sitting down; he spoke up very loudly. Well,
technically he was sitting—and he didn’t speak, he rapped
(and since its release on YouTube, his response has been
viewed over two million times). Sitting in a chair in a wellworn blue sweatshirt in his nondescript bedroom, he began:
“Yo, it’s geohot, and for those that don’t know, I’m getting
sued by Sony.” He thrashes his body in synch with the beat,
his boyish brown curls bobbing as he describes Sony as “fudge
packers” and ends with: “But shit man / they’re a corporation /
and I’m a personification / of freedom for all.”5
Sony’s civil suit not only named Hotz and several other
hackers, but also one hundred “John Does”—some of whom,
they suspected, to be members of Hotz’s anonymous hacker
team. Sony even targeted those who merely viewed Hotz’s
jailbreaking instructions. A legal notice to his web provider 
demanded the IP addresses of visitors to Hotz’s website
between 2009 and 2011. YouTube was asked to release information on those who had viewed Hotz’s jailbreak video or
posted comments about it. Many Internet geeks were appalled
at Sony’s lawsuit; this sentiment was captured well by the
science fiction writer and Internet advocate Cory Doctorow,
who opined that it was “absurd and unjust for a gargantuan
multinational to use its vast legal resources to crush a lone
hacker whose ‘crime’ is to figure out how to do (legal) stuff
with his own property.”6
Anonymous was thrown into a tizzy. The fact that Hotz
never sought aid (actually, he wanted nothing to do with
Anonymous) is irrelevant. Anonymous’s first announcement
read:
Dear Greedy Motherfuckers SONY,
Congratulations! You are now receiving the attention of
Anonymous. Your recent legal actions against fellow internet citizens, GeoHot and Graf_Chokolo, have been deemed
an unforgivable offense against free speech and internet
freedom, primary sources of free lulz (and you know how
we feel about lulz). You have abused the judicial system in
an attempt to censor information about how your products
work. You have victimized your own customers merely for
possessing and sharing information, and continue to target
those who seek this information. In doing so you have violated the privacy of thousands of innocent people who only
sought the free distribution of information. Your suppression of this information is motivated by corporate greed and
the desire for complete control over the actions of individuals who purchase and use your products, at least when those
actions threaten to undermine the corrupt stranglehold you
seek to maintain over copywrong, oops, “copyright.”7
Very quickly, the operation went south. DDoSing Sony’s
PlayStation Network (PSN) did not earn Anonymous any
LulzSec 245
246 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
new friends, only the ire of gamers who foamed with vitriol
at being deprived of their source of distraction. Amidst the
DDoSing, a splinter group calling itself “SonyRecon” formed
to dox Sony executives. This move proved controversial among
Anonymous activists and their broader support network.
Spurred by the operation’s immediate unpopularity,
Anonymous released the following statement: “We realized
that targeting the PSN is not a good idea. We have therefore
temporarily suspended our action until a method is found that
will not severely impact Sony’s customers.” They hoped that
this would put out the fire.
Throughout the month of April, however, PSN continued
to experience downtime. Since Anonymous had originally
called the operation, many naturally assumed that the masked
horde of activists was responsible for the ongoing problems.
But while there were a few scattered claims of responsibility, Anonymous eventually and unambiguously insisted, “For
once we did not do it.”
With no official word from Sony, rumor and innuendo
continued to swirl. After weeks of silence, on April 26, Sony
finally released an official statement: “We have discovered
that between April 17 and April 19, 2011, certain PlayStation
Network and Qriocity service user account information was
compromised in connection with an illegal and unauthorized
intrusion into our network.”8
 Millions of credit card numbers
were compromised, prompting Sony to encourage its customers to change their passwords and stay alert for signs of fraud.
And things only got worse with the announcement that PSN
would remain inaccessible. Colin Milburn, an academic and
avid gamer, wrote a riveting account of the infamous PSN
hack from the perspective of scorned gamers like himself; in
the essay he noted, “At this point, the emotional tide turned to
outrage—much of it directed at Sony for its lax security measures, much more directed at the hackers who had perpetrated
the intrusion.”9
 Ultimately, the downtime lasted an excruciating twenty-three days.10
By the end of May, Sony claimed that this hack had put
them $171 million in the red.11 Though Sony never provided
data about the financial losses, these events constituted a
fiasco, costing Sony money, time, and reputation. Sony executives, eventually called to testify to the US Congress, were
reprimanded for their organization’s reprehensible security practices and the delays in customer notification. In the
UK, Sony was fined nearly £250,000 by the Information
Commissioner’s Office, which pointed a clear finger of responsibility at the corporation itself:
If you are responsible for so many payment card details and
log-in details then keeping that personal data secure has to
be your priority. In this case that just didn’t happen, and
when the database was targeted—albeit in a determined
criminal attack—the security measures in place were simply
not good enough.12
In the midst of the turmoil, Sony executives attempted to
deflect blame onto Anonymous, claiming to have found a
file left on the group’s server identifying it as the responsible
party. But no Anonymous or LulzSec hacker has ever admitted
or been charged for this crime (and five of them, along with
two associates, have been found guilty of scores of hacking
crimes that involved their hard drives being trucked away for
forensic analysis). The PSN hack, a mystery in 2011, is still
unsolved today.
“Laundering money, funneling bitcoins, PPI
scaming, botnets, database dumping”
The drama that surrounded OpSony’s fouling of the
PlayStation Network provided the immediate context for
LulzSec’s germination. In mid-April, a few of the hackers on
#internetfeds managed to weasel their way into fox.com and
LulzSec 247
248 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
steal a sales database. Alongside personal information on Fox
employees and journalists, it included over seventy thousand
email addresses and passwords for people who had signed up
to receive updates about auditions for Fox’s forthcoming TV
talent show, The X Factor. The data also enabled Anons to
commandeer a few Fox News Twitter accounts. Since Fox had
not done anything egregious recently—aside from continuing
to exist—these hackers felt they were in a bind. Dropping
dox and corporate data under the aegis of Anonymous would
likely draw invective from the rank and file of the collective,
which prompted the Anons who had procured the database to
think about alternatives. The youngest of the bunch, tflow, was
ready with a suggestion, loosely inspired by weev’s trolling/
security outfit Goatse Security, which had released data
shaming AT&T:
<tflow>: We should make a competitor to Goatse Security
<tflow>: that hax for the lulz
<tflow>: Lulz4u Security
<pwnsauce>: LOL yes
<pwnsauce>: tflow have you log from last night??
<tflow>: which one?
<pwnsauce>: We needs get shell back
<pwnsauce>: uhm
<tflow>: ask X
<pwnsauce>: i think hes using his phone on this
To introduce the name “LulzSec,” tflow whipped out a timeless Internet classic—ASCII art:
<tflow>: ( ) ( )( )( ) (_ )/. |( )( ) / __)( ___)/ __)
<tflow>: )(__ )(__)( )(__ / /_(_ _))(__)( \__ \ )__)( (__
<tflow>: (____)(______)(____)(____) (_)(______) (___/(____)\___)
<tflow>: “We did it for the lulz” ~LulzSec
<pwnsauce>: NAICE
<pwnsauce>: make deface page? 
<pwnsauce>: BTW, I was thinking today
<Palladium>: haha
<tflow>: LulzSec, lulz division of the InternetFeds
<Palladium>: i’m more for polictically orintated hacks
<tflow>: yeah
<tflow>: but
<tflow>: what can we do with fox.com?
<tflow>: except for deface it for the lulz?
<tflow>: there’s nothing political about it
<tflow>: it’s not like when we defaced pm.gov.tn
<pwnsauce>: lol
For some reason, tflow’s proposal did not immediately catch
on. I asked him why and he could not recall. Perhaps there
were not enough people online to form a consensus, or perhaps
those logged into IRC were distracted with other tasks. There
are times when IRC conversations are hard to explain, even in
the moment, and it is best not to impute too much linear reasoning to them after the fact. So I’m not even going to try, at
least with this one. What we do know is that tflow temporarily quit Anonymous following a fight with a temperamental
operator who was about to turn on the AnonOps network.
And tflow wasn’t the only one. Others also took short leaves
of absence, only to return on May 4:
<Sabu>: tflow’s fine ass is back
<Falcon>: good times
<tflow>: what’s new?
<Falcon>: quite a bit tflow, good to see you back
<pwnsauce>: YAY
<Falcon>: this is Topiary by the way
<Sabu>: ;p
<Sabu>: good news is tflow is back
Reunited and it felt so good—but wouldn’t it feel even better
if they had a reason to dump the Fox data? By now the Sony
LulzSec 249
250 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
debacle made it doubly clear that random hacks could incur
the ire of Anonymous at large, so there was even more pressure not to release the data under the collective name. They
contemplated releasing it to 4chan, to “leak it under lowercase-anonymous,” as tflow phrased it. Sabu raised the idea
of handing the info to Forbes reporter Parmy Olson, hoping
that “maybe it will push her to write her book.” As we writers
know, there is nothing like a huge corporate data dump of
passwords and emails to put you in the right frame of mind
for a bout of writing. (Had they only given me the dump, this
book would have come out at least a year earlier.) But none of
these ideas were really taking hold. Eventually Topiary, who
for the last month had kept quiet on AnonOps but was on
the secret channels, logged into IRC under the name Falcon.
While Sabu suggested leaking it to Olson, Topiary suggested
leaking it via the LulzLeaks Twitter account:
<Falcon>: wait, let’s leak it under @LulzLeaks
<Falcon>: our twitter
tflow once again raised the name LulzSec, this time a little
more forcefully since it hadn’t caught on before:
<tflow>: we should establish a pseudo-lulzsec brand imo
<tflow>: like
<Sabu>: also someone contact parmy
<tflow>: Lulz4u Security
<Sabu>: tell her we got a new leak for her
<Sabu>: exclusive
<tflow>: Goatse Security
<pwnsauce>: YES
<pwnsauce>: tflow—I like
<Falcon>: Parmy’s sleeping
<Sabu>: wake her ass up
<Sabu>: hahaha
<Sabu>: think of a cool name guys 
<Sabu>: quick
<tflow>: Lulz4u Security?
Sabu was impatient:
<Sabu>: well
<Sabu>: why dont we just do this under the anonleaks banner
<Sabu>: ?
<tflow>: because
[…]
<pwnsauce>: I like LulzLeaks and Lulz4u Security
Others objected, again, making a distinction between ethical
and unethical leaking:
<tflow>: anonleaks is for ethical leaks
<lol>: :D
<tflow>: :P
<Falcon>: http://twitter.com/#!/LulzLeaks
<lol>: nah :D
<lol>: does it matter?
<Falcon>: LulzLeaks!
<lol>: no hacking and dumping data is ethical xD
<pwnsauce>: we have the LulzLeaks twatter xD
<Falcon>: here’s what we should do:
<Falcon>:—upload DB
<Falcon>:—dump on LulzLeaks
<Falcon>:—retweet from official Fox News twitters
After proposing a few other possible names, like “Ninjasec,”
they ultimately settled on LulzSec. With a name in place, they
began discussing the release and artwork:
<Sabu>: Lulz Security / lulzsec
<Falcon>: kind of want to put Batman fucking up a shark as the
picture
LulzSec 251
252 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Falcon>: but I already burned that one
<Sabu>: lol
<Sabu>: well lets hold onto those for a week or so
<Sabu>: let the x factor leak get attention
<Sabu>: then we’ll abuse fox managers/sales
<Sabu>: then we’ll embarrass fbi with infragard
<Falcon>: someone get @lulzsec everywhere
<Falcon>: news, /b/, somewhere where it will spread
<Falcon>: AnonOps
When something is new and shiny, it makes sense to trot out
an introduction:
<tflow>: write a statement?
<Falcon>: Not sure what we’d write… hmm.
<Falcon>: I guess we could introduce ourselves.
<Falcon>: As LulzSec.
In three minutes, Topiary whipped one out. Then he celebrated
with … cookies:
<Falcon>: Hello, good day, and how are you? Splendid! We’re
LulzSec, a small team of lulzy individuals who feel the drabness of the
cyber community is a burden on what matters: fun. Considering fun
is now restricted to Friday, where we look forward to the weekend,
weekend, we have now taken it upon ourselves to spread fun, fun,
fun, throughout the entire calender year. As an introduction, please
find…
<Falcon>: …below the X-Factor 2011 contestants’ contact
information. Expect more to come, and if you’re like us and like seeing
other people get mad, check out our twitter! twitter.com/LulsSec
<tflow>: perfect
<Falcon>: though that’s @LulzSec
<Falcon>: shit son I wrote that off the top of my head in 2 minutes,
BRB getting a cookie
Topiary and Sabu offered prescient predictions:
<Sabu>: oh man lol
<Sabu>: this is going to be fun
<Falcon>: LulzSec at its finest
<Falcon>: laundering money, funneling bitcoins, PPI scaming,
botnets, database dumping
<Falcon>: the lulz they do go on
All the hype, however, was for naught. The first dump yielded
little in the way of media response. LulzSec was still totally
unknown; it was Friday after all, a terrible day to release
something to the media. And so the hackers, secure in their
newfound identity as LulzSec, could turn to the juicy gossip
about an AnonOps operator named Ryan Cleary, who had
recently gone rogue.
Cleary, who commanded a large botnet, was one of the
most unpopular and powerful operators on the AnonOps IRC
network. On numerous occasions, I heard complaints about
his erratic behavior, like randomly banning participants on the
private and public channels. Soon after LulzSec formed, news
broke that Cleary had DDoSed the AnonOps network that
he once helped administer. He also dropped over six hundred
names and IP addresses of IRC network users. (AnonOps had
a policy of not retaining IP addresses after someone disconnected, but during the connection, AnonOps had access to
the users’ IP addresses of all those not cloaked by a VPN.)
Why did he do this? After one too many fights with other
operators, he had decided to take his revenge. At the same
time, according to one of his Anonymous hacker associates, he
wanted to impress an underground hacker group called Hack
the Planet, better known as simply HTP. From 2011 to 2013,
according to a hacker who followed the group, HTP were
quite active and in possession of “a large, and impressive, list
of stuff.” The group has since gone into retirement but HTP
had little love for Anonymous, a sentiment made clear in the
LulzSec 253
254 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
final sentence of their final zine: “Here’s to two years of HTP,
everyone. Remember; relax, have fun, be the best, and DDoS
Anonymous on sight.”13
What better way to impress a respected underground hacker
group that loathes Anonymous than by sacrificing Anons,
some of them your friends? (Later Cleary recanted and was,
according to tflow, “jealous of LulzSec and desperately tried
to get in, which is why he offered us his botnet.”) Petty hacker
wars have long been a great asset to law enforcement investigations. Unsurprisingly, after Cleary’s dick move, someone
loosely affiliated with Anonymous doxed him right back.
Nobody knew for certain if the revealed name was correct,
but, as with Sabu, time would prove that it was. LulzSec,
referenced explicitly in HTP’s newsletter, reflected upon the
recent events:
<Sabu>: but we need to own ryan
<Sabu>: he violated anonymous very seriously with this
<Falcon>: or something
<lol>: well we got his dox [n]ow
<Falcon>: his voice annoys me
The remaining AnonOps operators, livid at what Cleary
had done, released an apologetic statement to the broader
Anonymous community and encouraged people to stay the
hell away for a while as they went to work assembling a more
secure system. This cooldown set the perfect stage for LulzSec
to walk into the restless media spotlight.
LulzSec Proper
LulzSec set sail with a cargo hold full from the Fox data dump, a
newly minted Twitter account, and bounteous, absurd Internet
meme art and statements, as exemplified by the justification
given when they ultimately released the Fox data: “You know 
who we defend? Common. Fox called him a ‘vile rapper’; we
call Fox common scum. You think we’re done? The fun has
only just begun.”14 The team was already well accustomed to
each crewmember’s distinctive rhythms and quirks. They had
become so close, in fact, that everyone knew, roughly, where
everyone else was logging in from (though real names were
never shared). Most were headquartered in or around the
UK, except Sabu. Some had even foolishly spoken over Skype,
which is how Topiary had determined that Cleary’s voice was
“annoying.”
OpSec, short for operational security, is the art of protecting
your group’s human and digital interactions. One of the foundations of good OpSec is an awareness of the security level
of one’s computer and network. Depending on proprietary
software packages—opaque in both source code and business practices—can compromise that knowledge. The use of
free software, such as GNU/Linux, and the avoidance of tools
like Skype (commonly understood to have government backdoors) are necessary measures in the never-ending journey of
vigilant OpSec. Keeping personal information private is also
a central pillar of OpSec. If you volunteer this information, it
doesn’t matter how secure your software and hardware might
be. All of these considerations, and more, need to be managed
before any hacker rampage—anything less is simply asking
to be caught. Which is to say (with a few exceptions), OpSec
was not one of LulzSec’s strongest points. In fact, following
the eventual spate of LulzSec arrests, their practices would
become a model, for other hackers and activists, of just what
not to do.
But these worries were far on the horizon, and the sea
appeared vast—even infinite. Over the next month and a half,
LulzSec’s accomplishments would prove riveting. One might
assume that I am referring to its technical inventiveness. In
fact, with a few clever exceptions, LulzSec hacks were most
notable for their audacity and style, and not for their rocket
science.
LulzSec 255
256 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
LulzSec’s true importance came in its ability to force a much
deeper recognition and debate about a range issues from the
pathetic state of Internet security to the insatiable appetites of
media sensationalism.
“Why we secretly love LulzSec” (Not So Secretly, Actually)
Not all hackers held warm and fuzzy feelings for Anonymous.
Its interventions were often too technically unsophisticated to
garner craft respect. Some hackers felt that its tactics damaged
the larger cause of Internet freedom, while others viewed its
antics as puerile. And for some hackers the general style of
disruptive activism, however interesting, was simply not their
cup of tea. But with LulzSec it was a different story. A surprising number of hackers, especially security hackers, adored the
new group, or at least held an ambivalent respect. To understand why, allow me to offer a portrait of this subset of hacker
by recounting my own introduction to the type.
Before the rise of LulzSec, I became acquainted with the
InfoSec community in New York City, largely through force
majeure. Apparently I had offended some security hackers by
anointing, in writing, open-source developers—programmers
who release their source code with permissive licenses—as
hackers. In the wake of such a debasing “mistake,” security
researchers, who also call themselves hackers, reached out to
me in various ways—from constructive suggestions and discussion invitations, to creepy jeers and intimidating threats. They
wanted to educate me about what “real” hackers were: themselves. You think a DIY, remote-controlled toaster running on
a twenty-five dollar, open-source computer called Raspberry
Pi constitutes hacking? Nope, sorry. Or how about programming LED blinky throwies, which you plan on distributing
at a rave? Nope again. These may be cool and useful gadgets
that require technical proficiency—and they certainly might
be blinky—but they are not HACKING. Hacking, they would 
tell me, is digital trespass: breaking into a system, owning it
hard, doing what you want with it. I had recently published
my book on free software “hackers,” Coding Freedom: The
Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking, and it seemed that these
InfoSec word warriors thought I had a narrow understanding
of the term, one that omitted their world. But, my understanding of the term is much more nuanced than they realized. My
definition includes free software programmers, people who
make things, and also people who compromise systems—but
that doesn’t mean they have to all be talked about at the same
time. My first book was narrowly focused.
Interestingly, while each microcommunity claims the
moniker “hacker,” some always refute the attempts of other
microcommunities to claim the term. So when InfoSec people
started yelling at me that free software “hackers” weren’t
“hackers,” I wasn’t surprised. I actually appreciated the productive discussions—much more than the veiled threats.
Sometime in 2010 an email arrived in my inbox from a
respected hacker encouraging me to attend NYSEC, the informal New York City gathering of security professionals and
hackers held monthly at a bar. Or as their Twitter bio describes
it, “A drinking meet-up with an information security problem.”
I figured why not. This was the cordial way of telling me: get
real, start hanging out with real hackers. Others were less
amicable. One of these “hackers” contacted me by email to
generously offer me his entire collection of the hacker zine
2600 for my research. I was excited to add the zines to my personal library, and we met at a tiny New York City cafe. Upon
broaching the subject of my book, he became agitated, huffing
that “configuring Linux is not hacking.” This gentleman, who
was probably almost forty-five years old, was so upset that he
abruptly got up and left. Gentle, compared to the time when a
hacker found me online and warned me that he had just witnessed a slew of hackers scheming over IRC to hack into my
computer—to teach me a lesson about what real hackers do.
Nothing like a show-and-tell hack to make a point. Freaked
LulzSec 257
258 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
out, I locked down my systems enough to secure myself and
I suspect that the acquaintance who warned me might have
convinced the zealous hackers to cool their loins.
Of course, not every security hacker is diametrically
opposed to extending the label to free/open-source software
developers. Many hackers who deal in matters of security use
and write open-source software themselves. One such hacker
based in Montreal, David Mirza, has spent countless hours
teaching me about the complicated aesthetics and politics of
the hacker underground. Formerly in the black hat scene, he
now runs an InfoSec company and is an unflagging proponent
of open-source software.
But there are differences, important ones. Many of these
hackers who work as contractors or on security for governments or corporations constantly face Herculean challenges
when securing software applications, operating systems,
servers, and networked systems. To truly secure a system
means, at a minimum, to occupy the mindset of every possible
infiltrator. Often this means engaging in intrusion oneself. This
is why many of the best security hackers are former black hats
who still might, on occasion, dabble in activity residing in legal
gray zones. InfoSec hackers tend to be a touch paranoid, and it
is no wonder why. You would be too if you spent most of your
waking hours refining your own intrusion capabilities while
simultaneously fending off credit card scammers, Russian
Business Network associates, Bulgarian virus writers, Chinese
state hackers, and the hundreds of other bad actors who actively
seek to access valuable systems. Hackers whose ensure security
bear the burden of paranoia so the rest of us can sleep a little
better at night. (But don’t rest too soundly; their advice is often
not heeded.)
Anyone who has hung out with hackers knows that when it
comes to technology, all types of hackers are unabashed snobs.
This stance is not unique to security hackers vs. free software evangelists, nor is it unique to hackers more generally.
Vocational arrogance is common to craftspeople—doctors, 
professors, academics, journalists, and furniture makers. It is
simple: the fine art of haughtiness pushes one to do better.
However (and for reasons that still mostly elude me), when
compared to other activities that might also be considered
“hacking,” security specialists take elitism to incomparable
heights. Praise does not flow easy from the lips of these InfoSec
men and woman.
Combining this simplified picture with a recognition of
InfoSec’s historical derision of Anonymous allows us to more
fully appreciate why the security community’s adoration
of LulzSec is all the more remarkable. The following 2011
Halloween photo might best sum it up:15
LulzSec 259
Dressed as LulzSec, these New York City–based hackers
were not only living large and having a grand time—they were
also giving mad props to the rebel, misfit hackers. While all the
characteristics of the LulzSec mythology are represented, there
is one additional element that may not be so obvious: the lack
of pants. Many considered LulzSec to be pointing, in badass
Internet style, to the fact that the Emperor Has No Clothes.
Since forever, security professionals have been yelling from the
top of a lonely, wind-swept, barren mountaintop about the
dire need for organizations to invest more resources, energy, 
260 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
time, and personnel toward better security. LulzSec, it seemed,
had finally found a way to get people to listen.
One may wonder why security is so weak in a sector so
large and profitable. After all, cyber (fear) sells.16 Not only
does the industry regularly sell software scams (such as outof-the-box software solutions that cannot be configured to
address the risk profiles unique to an institution), or products intended to replace a dedicated security team that can do
more harm than good, but the initial desire for security itself
remains a low priority for many firms, even well-funded ones.
A New York City–based security hacker explained: “One
of the challenges in security is how to get people to take it
seriously because at the executive level it just looks like an
expense.” The fact that Sony—a multinational corporation
—could get pillaged with such impunity in 2011 is an indicator of the depth and nature of the problems. Cases like these
make hackers who create secure systems completely furious.
LulzSec, more than any other person, report, or group in
recent memory, managed to convey a message that many
security professionals had been unsuccessfully pitching for
over two decades. The effects were similar to the antagonistic antics of L0pht Heavy Industries, a loose association of
hackers who regularly met in person. In 1998, during a group
conversation, a couple of them coined the term “gray hat”
to describe hackers who are ambiguously—and deliberately—
situated between the black and white labels that had come
to distinguish malicious hackers from more benevolent ones.
“Gray hat” hackers are not above acting illegally, but typically they do so only to identify, and publicize, vulnerabilities.
L0pht became so successful that in May 1998, seven of its
members were invited to testify (in semi-theatrical fashion)
to the Committee on Governmental Affairs chaired by
Republican Senator Fred Thompson. With his refined, somber,
and heavy Tennessee accent, Senator Thompson introduced
the “hacker think tank” and explained that “due to the sensitivity of the work done at the L0pht, they will be using their 
hacker handles: Mudge, Weld, Brian Oblivion, Kingpin, Space
Rogue, Tan, and Stefan.”17 Muffled laughter rippled through
the chambers, likely because hacker handles were superfluous: C-SPAN recorded the testimony and the hackers were
unmasked. Their remarks addressed numerous topics, but the
claim that they could take down the entire Internet in thirty
minutes jumped out from the rest. This was meant not as a
threat. It was a plea to improve the abysmal state of Internet
security in 1998.
L0pht’s testimony to Congress was deferential; many of the
participants wore suits, and an effort was made to present
broadly intelligible explanations. LulzSec was not invited to
visit Congress—nor could they take down the Internet—but
in the course of their errant questing they managed to deliver a
similar message. They made people pay attention to the sordid
state of Internet security—not by offering a carefully constructed testimonial, but in the mere course of their travels in
search of adventure (which happened to include over a dozen
high-profile hacks along the way). They did so in the face of
US laws, like the CFAA, that were designed to punish any
hacker who got caught, regardless of motivation. LulzSec’s
gutsy hacks against corporate giants and government agencies, now the stuff of legend, were quite effective—maybe even
necessary—to get people to wake up.
Many security experts I interviewed directly cited LulzSec’s
role in making high-level executives heed their messages, at
least for a short while (2013 saw a string of massive data
breaches: Adobe, Target, Neiman Marcus, LivingSocial,
the Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts,
Evernote, Drupal.org, the US Federal Reserve, OKCupid …
the list goes on).18 A 2011 blog post by security researcher
and journalist Patrick Gray entitled “Why We Secretly Love
LulzSec” was widely read among security professionals and
captured their prevailing mood. He explained to me the
impact of his piece: “It picked up more buzz than anything I’d
ever written, including pieces for ZDNet/CNet, The Sydney
LulzSec 261
262 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Morning Herald, The Age, Wired … I’ve written plenty of
news stories that went big globally, but this was something
entirely different.” In the piece, Gray wrote:
It might be surprising to external observers, but security
professionals are also secretly getting a kick out of watching these guys go nuts … The mainstrem media are having
fun criticizing Sony for its poor security, but do we honestly
think for a second that the XBox Live network can’t be similarly pwnt? (I know the PSN breach hasn’t been pinned on
LulzSec, but the point stands.) Is there any target out there
that can’t be “gotten”?19
Even if the innumerable security problems plaguing the
Internet could not be magically fixed, it was still satisfying to
call out the “elephant in the room,” as Gray tagged it.
LulzSec’s spectacle also revealed the hypocritical charade
of many firms, as they performed strange acrobatics to shift
blame. A New York City–based security researcher who
prefers to remain anonymous explained:
One thing I think is interesting is that these people [corporations] are getting owned every day, but their info isn’t
getting splattered all over the Internet. It’s usually getting
owned by people doing it for profit. The irony is that when
people are stealing intellectual property for financial advantage, they won’t do anything about it … I think it’s ironic
now that LulzSec is making people eat their vegetables.
This position was echoed by Chris Wysopal, one of the original members of L0pht, who now runs a well-respected security
firm:
Corporations take public embarrassment more seriously
than stolen intellectual property. The Sony attacks sent chills
down the spines of Fortune 100 CISOs and their boards. We 
had customers come to us and literally say, “I don’t want to
be another Sony.” They scanned thousands of websites and
remediated hundreds of critical vulnerabilities so that didn’t
happen to them. In this way, LulzSec made the Internet more
resilient. In some ways it is like an immunization giving your
immune system a taste of the virus that would otherwise
kill you and force your immune system to work to build
protection.
LulzSec’s popularity among security types exceeded its
practical role of forcing executives to “eat their vegetables.”
Its rich but accessible visual vocabulary incarnated the subversive pleasure and magic of hacking, so often left invisible.
You may think that making or breaking, exploiting or building, securing and pen-testing cannot involve artistry, creative
expression, and pleasure—but this is exactly what these
technologists experience: bliss (along with the type of agonizing frustration that only makes the bliss doubly potent in
its overcoming). Conveying the nature of this gratification to
outsiders is next to impossible, because the technical craft is
so esoteric. LulzSec’s publicized antics are the most accurate
representation I have ever seen of the look, feel, and sensibilities that attend the pleasures of hacking. And each piece
of LulzSec’s iconography symbolizes the sensual and ideological sides of this world: the boat (standing for the pirate
freedom of the high seas), the man with the monocle and suit
(snooty l33t hacker), the cat (because if it is related to the
Internet, there must be felines), the music (hacking to music
is always preferable to doing the deed in silence), manifestos
(free expression, dammit!), and law breaking (because rules,
fuck them). LulzSec embodied the pleasure of hacking and
subversion like no other group. LulzSec also represented a site
of longing and fantasy. What the team did so blatantly was
something many hackers wished they were doing. Some had
certainly experienced the same illicit pleasures in days gone
by, when the world of computing first opened up to them
LulzSec 263
264 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
through exploration and tinkering—but this was typically
done without a massive global audience.
Now, not all hackers adored the crew. HTP, the group that
loved to pwn Anonymous, extended its loathing to LulzSec.
As one LulzSec member who went by the name pwnsauce put
it, “HTP saw us as attention-whoring fucknuggets, basically.”
HTP’s viewpoint reflects a long-held ethos in the hacker underground, one that drives some hackers to snub those seeking
attention from the mainstream press (attention is anathema to
staying out of the “clink”—and LulzSec’s failure proved the
wisdom of this folk ethos). Even if LulzSec hackers did not
do many interviews, they were nevertheless doing everything
possible to land major stories by drawing as much attention
to themselves as possible. They once did so by attacking the
media itself.
Media
Anonymous may not ever have (readily) nominated any
individuals to speak on its behalf, but it hosted an IRC
channel, #reporter, where dozens of journalists interviewed
participants. LulzSec was more secretive, offering no public
channel for journalistic access and giving almost no interviews in general (except to Parmy Olson and, occasionally,
Steve Ragan). There was no celebrity to showcase, except the
group itself. Nevertheless, by the end of June 2011, LulzSec
had become something like hacker rock stars. This foray
into celebrity territory drew some furrowed eyebrows from
the broader Anonymous community, but, for the most part,
there was enough distance—LulzSec repeatedly confirmed
its autonomy—that even the pseudonymous collective from
which LulzSec broke away could enjoy the show without
feeling that it affected its own mores and ethical sensibilities.
LulzSec, unlike AnonOps, clawed at the media. Its major
hack against the press was directed against PBS in retaliation 
LulzSec 265
for its Frontline film on WikiLeaks, WikiSecrets. The documentary drew the ire of LulzSec members, notably Sabu, who
disliked the film for how it skirted the pressing political issues
raised by Cablegate in favor of a sensationalist psychoanalyzing of the “dark” inner life of Chelsea Manning. LulzSec
launched a two-pronged campaign. They dumped the personal data of PBS staff and defaced its website, leaving a clever
article that could almost pass as real (see figure overleaf).
Even if the article was destined (and designed) to be understood as a fake, it worked as a hoax. Perhaps because the
scenario was hypothetically plausible, Topiary (its writer)
sprinkled the article with giveaways. The proposed source of
information—a hand-written diary—was absurdly quaint by
today’s standards. And the most unbelievable nugget was the
suggestion that law enforcement was in on the arrangement—
not only because privacy is in short supply for celebrities, but
because privacy itself has been nonexistent for a long time.
Just in case you were fooled, the story’s kicker jolts you back
to reality with the nonsensical statement “yank up as a vital
obituary” (an anagram of the handles of the LulzSec members
who participated in the hack, Topiary, Sabu, Kayla, Avunit),
and a reference to the diary-writer’s girlfriend, Penny—named
after none other than HBGary’s president.
While some were disturbed by an attack directed at the
media, the Twitter frenzy as the story spread mostly showed
adulation. The allure of this act can be explained if we turn
to an anthropological definition of defacement provided in
Michael Taussig’s striking book on the topic: “Defacement
works on objects the way jokes work on language, bringing
out their inherent magic nowhere more so than when those
objects have become routinized.”20 LulzSec laid bare the
subject of celebrity by defacing a media object—the journalistic article—with a strong dose of humor.
Every major Western news establishment ran a piece about
the bogus article, and most skimmed over the part about the
ethically questionable data breach. The political motivation 
TUPAC STILL ALIVE IN NEW ZEALAND
Prominent rapper Tupac has been
found alive and well in a small
resort in New Zealand, locals
report. The small town—unnamed
due to security risks—allegedly
housed Tupac and Biggie Smalls
(another rapper) for several years.
One local, David File, recently
passed away, leaving evidence
and reports of Tupac’s visit in a
diary, which he requested be shipped
to his family in the United States.
“We were amazed to see what David left behind,” said one of sisters,
Jasmine, aged 31. “We thought it best to let the world know as we
feel this doesn’t deserve to be kept secret.”
David, aged 28, was recently the victim of a hit-and-run by local
known gangsters. Having suffered several bullet wounds on his way
home from work, David was announced dead at the scene. Police
found the diary in a bedside drawer.
“Naturally we didn’t read the diary,” one officer states. “We merely
noted the request to have it sent to a US address, which we did to
honor the wishes of David.”
Officials have closed down routes into the town and will not speculate
as to whether Tupac or Biggie have been transported to another region
or country. Local townsfolk refuse to comment on exactly how long or
why the rappers were being sheltered; one man simply says “we don’t
talk about that here.”
The family of David File have since requested that more action be
taken to arrest those responsible for the shooting. “David was a
lovely, innocent boy,” reported his mother. “When he moved to New
Zealand, he’d never been happier.”
His brother Jason requested that one part of David’s diary be made
public in an attempt to decipher it. “Near the end,” Jason says,
“there’s a line that reads ‘yank up as a vital obituary’, which we’ve so
far been unable to comprehend.”
David’s girlfriend, Penny, did not wish to make a statement.”
behind the hack received only cursory treatment, even though
LulzSec published an explicit statement rationalizing its
actions. This was a further (and ironic) demonstration of the
mainstream media’s proclivity for sensationalizing issues—the
very behavior exhibited by the WikiLeaks documentary that
prompted the operation in the first place.
“We futurescan”
One might think that the corporate response to LulzSec, and
by extension Anonymous, was wholly negative. In reality, it
was a little more complicated. Starting in the fall of 2011 and
peaking in 2012, various individuals and institutions situated
in and around the highest echelons of the corporate world
began to contact me. I spoke with the founding partner of a
venture capitalist firm in New York City, the head of European
security for Vodafone, and a senior vice president from TTI/
Vanguard (self-described as “a unique forum for senior-level
executives that links strategic technology planning to business
success”). I gave two talks (one virtual) for an NYU global
risk and security group that included chief security officers
(CSOs) and other executives from major corporations. Finally
I participated at an event run by “World 50,” an organization
that convenes events for senior executives of mostly Fortune
500 companies.
The list would be incomplete without mentioning my 2012
talk at TEDGlobal in Edinburgh, Scotland. While TED’s
online videos reach a popular audience of millions, the conference itself is primarily attended by wealthy elites—with the
exception of some of the speakers, such as myself, and select
attendees who receive financial aid from TED. The privilege
of attending TED costs roughly $6,000. Of course, one has to
be chosen first (you have to apply). This does not include the
costs of travel or accommodations, but it does grant access to
some fancy parties featuring copious food and drink, concerts,
LulzSec 267
268 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
highly curated TED talks, and the opportunity to converse
with some famous and fascinating people (or their assistants,
at least). After my talk, Will Smith’s personal assistant struck
up a conversation with me, making a vigorous attempt to convince me that his boss, who is rumored to be a Scientologist,
is actually an avid fan of Anonymous. Was he social-engineering me in an attempt to protect his boss from a potentially
career-damaging attack by Anonymous, or did we really just
randomly bump into each other?
That was pretty tame compared to another memorable
encounter. While sampling the delicious snacks during one of
the breaks, a Fortune 500 executive snuck up on me, clutched
my arm—rather too tightly, I felt—and, clearly projecting
his anxiety onto me, whispered loudly into my ear: “You are
sooooooo brave to study Anonymous.” Just the day before,
I had visited a local Anon and his partner. The highlight was
touring their garden, where I saw their beehive, followed
by a very tasty home-cooked meal of pheasant and sweet
potato mash. Afterwards, we watched the documentary We
Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists and his partner was
rather floored to learn that there was actually some political
substance to Anonymous. All this time, she had thought he
had been messing around on his computer engaging in purely
juvenile acts. After this gentle experience with a “dreaded”
Anon, I found it hard to roll over for this executive’s praises
of bravery and courage. I guess I could have been stung by a
bee? I thought to myself.
At one level, these men and women struck me as regular
folk. They complained about their spoiled sons and daughters, the exorbitant cost of higher education in the United
States, and (some of them, at least—a naturalized Canadian,
now that I remember) the lack of universal health care in the
United States. Many even engaged in a time-honored workplace pastime: railing against their immediate overseer. Of
course, in this milieu, that usually happened to be the CEO of
a mega corporation. But make no mistake: during the World 
50 event held at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San
Francisco, I heard two twenty-something caterers mutter to
each other, not caring that I could plainly overhear, that “it is a
different world in there.” Take the name tags were were given
at the event. These weren’t some piece-of-paper-shoved-ina-plastic-sleeve-with-some-kind-of-branding lanyards. These
looked like they came straight out of Restoration Hardware
(a high-end American furniture store). Made of metal, the
clasp was powered by a magnet. In a pinch, you could probably use one as a ninja throwing star. Sadly, I only used mine
to identify myself. After acquiring my name tag and a lunch
of seared tuna and other delicacies, we were moved upstairs
to an airy, sun-drenched private room decked out with plush
chairs for talks, which ranged in subject from massive open
online courses (or MOOCs) to Anonymous (mine, of course).
In the audience were executives from AstraZeneca, Cargill,
Hewlett-Packard, Hilton Worldwide, Huawei Technologies,
Hyatt Hotels, Juniper Networks, Monsanto, Rio Tinto, The
Coca-Cola Company, and Tiffany & Co. Even though lunch
had just been provided, there was an impressive ensemble of snacks and drinks, including beautiful glasses full of
M&Ms and ten beverage choices. After the talks, everyone
was whisked away to a dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Bay Bridge, which started with an intimate talk by
Steve Martin.
Not surprisingly, corporate executives, especially from blue
chip companies, wanted nothing more than for someone to
wave a wand and make both Anonymous and LulzSec disappear. Executives from technology companies seemed curious
and, if nothing else, at least familiar with Anonymous’s
involvement in a range of political movements. Sometimes
they were even interested to learn about Anonymous’s role in
the Arab Spring. Executives from financial and energy firms
tended to be frosty, while those from other industries showed
curious mixtures of disgust and fear. One head of communications for a low-cost airline jokingly wished Anonymous
LulzSec 269
270 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
would hack her company—the free publicity would be
stellar.
What was less expected was a query that I received about
Anonymous’s potential contribution to the corporate world.
TTI/Vanguard approached me to assess whether I could give
a talk along these lines to its clients, such as Royal Dutch
Shell, Northrop Grumman, Toyota, FedEx, and Expedia. I
discovered that TTI/Vanguard was primarily involved in
“futurescanning.” Apparently, “TTI/Vanguard heightens
thinking about technological possibilities. We futurescan. We
focus on unanticipated sources of change and evaluate their
transformative promise. In dynamic, highly interactive sessions, debate is stimulated and breakthrough ideas flourish.”21
This is the culture that adopts “disruptive” strategies for
the attention economy, for capital gain. Anonymous and
LulzSec disrupted in the classical way—without clarification.
Sometimes they even fucked shit up. They also demonstrated
the importance of art, expression, autonomy, and creation
through unalienated labor. Most multinational companies are
not compatible with these ideals; they cannot implement these
lessons, at least not in a fulfilling and honest way.
TTI/Vanguard’s mission statement marked my first exposure to “futurescanning,” but then it started popping up
everywhere. The most surprising of the bunch came during
a phone call with Chris Anderson, the head of TED, prior to
the summer event in Edinburgh. He asked whether my talk
could include some practical insight for corporate management. Though his request was subtle, it was clear he wanted
me to relay a (hyper-inspirational, astonishing, disruptive)
lesson from the trenches of Anonymous that could upend
conventional wisdom and embolden corporate thinking. Until
then, I had worked mostly with TED’s other curator, Bruno
Giussani. TED vets everything down to the word—he asked
me to nix the word “homeland” since it was too politically
charged. That said, Giussani was otherwise hands off, offering
helpful suggestions that I could adopt or reject. Frankly, I was 
surprised by Anderson’s query. It was clear that if I adopted
the corporate lingo, and came up with some whiz-bang way
of packaging Anonymous using shallow, amazing-sounding,
paradigm-shifting phrases combined with confusing technobabble, all delivered with breathless enthusiasm, I would have
the perfect formula to inspire in these corporate drones the
feeling of being in on some mind-blowing insights. And then I
could make a lot of money running around bullshitting people
until the next paradigm rolled over.
These exchanges gave me a fresh perspective on a contemporary vector of co-optation. Academics who write about the
subject have often approached it from the angles of advertising, entertainment, and consumerism—the classic example
being Dick Hebdige’s seminal analysis of the commodification of punk rock.22 Countercultural forces of critique, of
which punk rock was emblematic, are devitalized when
channeled through the corporate advertising apparatus, or
turned into commodities through the processing mechanisms
of Hollywood or the fashion industry. What I always found
interesting about Anonymous was how it had, at least until
recently,23 resisted these forces for one primary reason: most
corporations are wary of commodifying Anonymous because
they know how direct the repercussions might be. In fact, the
case of Anonymous is a curious one in which the opposite
process more often occurs; though it is true that Time Warner
makes a buck whenever someone buys an official Guy Fawkes
mask (Time Warner holds the copyright to the V for Vendetta
movie), Anonymous has taken a symbol popularized by
Hollywood and made it revolutionary. It is a prime example
of counter-commodification, a rare occurance.
But if there’s one lesson from the corporate execs, it’s this:
even if they aren’t about to claim Anonymous’s imagery for
their next advertising campaign, it doesn’t mean they can’t,
or won’t, find some way to appropriate something about
Anonymous. If someone can find an uncapitalized, exploitable, futurescanned, innovative, disruptive idea that can
LulzSec 271
272 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
flourish in corporate boardrooms, they will. This move, while
distinct from more familiar forms of co-optation—since the
knowledge transfer may not (necessarily) alter the phenomenon being scrutinized—is still worth understanding a little
better. There is a pervasive cottage industry (in the form of
think tanks, organizations, and motivational speakers, many
from academia, especially pundits who love to inflate the
promise of technology) that exists to capture wisdom from
every corner of the globe (from gang culture to the Arab
Spring) and convert it into a formula for corporate success.
This is done so that corporate executives can keep abreast of
global challenges, feel great about what they do, strengthen
corporate cultural machinery, and make a lot of money off
of culture that they don’t have to invest in. I suspect in some
instances, when corporate executives hone in on a phenomenon like open source, they not only harvest insights for their
corporations, but have the power to recalibrate public opinion
on the topic. We know very little about the reach of these
networks and the possible effects that “futurescanning” might
aggregate. It is a subject that would certainly be worth understanding better. Maybe we need to “futurescan” futurescanning
ourselves.
“I tell you: one must still have chaos within
oneself, to give birth to a dancing star”
LulzSec was not only embraced and celebrated by hackers.
It was also widely popular among Internet geeks, political
activists, and academics, along with a host of other unmarked
spectators. To understand why, it helps to look to the nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,
whose investments in questioning truth and morality, elevating
pleasure over reason, and embracing cunning and hyperbole
can be used (playfully and experimentally) to form the intellectual scaffolding for the work LulzSec and Anonymous did 
150 years later. (Indeed, had Nietzsche been teleported into
the future and developed a knack for hacking, I suspect he just
might have joined LulzSec.)
Nietzsche took the Enlightenment project of critique so
much to heart that he turned out to be one of its unremitting
critics—helping to inaugurate a more general project of radical
philosophy, which would be expanded upon in the twentieth
century by a cohort of writers, most famously Gilles Deleuze,
Félix Guattari, and Michel Foucault. We might even think of
Nietzsche as the Enlightenment’s trickster. The objects of his
critique were rationality, progress, God, science, and the way
that ideas or systems based on absolutist tropes—whether
proclaiming truth in science or God—become, in earning
wide adoption, more resistant to critique and more capable of
binding humans in their grips. For Nietzsche, nothing should
be de facto granted or a priori assumed: neither good and
evil, nor true and false. Every piece of knowledge that humans
conceive of, make, or even discover by looking at the world
is, according to Nietzsche, provisional, rooted in judgment,
and, though often seeming timeless or natural, understandable
only within a specific historical moment.
Nietzsche sought to dismantle the ideological stronghold of
truth, rationality, and conventional moral systems for complex
reasons. Suffice to say, for our purposes, that he wanted to
highlight how the mantle of truth exerts a monopolistic force.
Truth implies right, better, and good. Anything sanctioned as
truth then works to devalue other domains of creation and
experience, like art and myth, which lie outside the orbit of
“truth” and are thus slotted in the category of “falsehood.” In
this ideological binary, art becomes a second-class citizen in
the public life of ideas, while fantasy and myth are hardly even
allowed to join the party.
Nietzsche was attuned to the vitality of sensuality, myth,
and art. Music, poetry, and even the mad laughter of the trickster Dionysus, who he championed, offer an aesthetic life
of pleasure.24 They are pursuits through which humans can
LulzSec 273
274 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
overcome their limits and the tragic condition of life: “Not by
wrath does one kill but by laughter. Come, let us kill the spirit
of gravity!”25
More than any other political movement in recent times,
Anonymous, and especially its LulzSec offshoot, gives forceful
social shape to a number of these Nietzschean philosophical
themes. If Nietzsche argued that nothing is sacred, and advocated for a life of enchantment, then LulzSec and Anonymous
lived these maxims out. They dared to subvert and break
formal law, etiquette, and mores, and experimented with the
art of transgression. They reminded us: to make life into art,
and art into life, you sometimes need to break rules.
And breaking rules is a difficult task. Back when I taught
a course in Communication and Culture, I used to have my
undergraduate students violate a norm in public and report
back on their experiences. With the exception of one or two
eccentrics, who rather enjoyed the assignment (one of them
recounted gleefully that her mother walked her by leash and
collar, like a dog, on the streets of New York City—and barely
anyone batted an eye), it was an extraordinarily hard, even
painful, exercise. In fact, a good quarter of the class broke
rules in ways that hardly constituted “daring” at all, like
asking someone at a cafe whether they could sit at their table.
The pressure to conform to conventions and accept given
wisdom is enormous—and often for good reason. Much of
Nietzsche’s corpus laid bare this tendency and warned of its
pernicious effects, which is what the trickster myths address,
time and again, albeit in different form. Indeed, one of
Nietzsche’s most famous characters, Zarathustra, is a tricksterlike figure. Living as a hermit for a decade in the mountains, he
comes to the realization that one can overcome social mores
in favor of self-defined desires and ideas. He descends to share
this insight, advocating a process he calls “self-overcoming.”
Anonymous and LulzSec have existed as instantiations of
Zarathustra. LulzSec went a step further than Anonymous,
breaking even the rules that had inadvertently taken root in 
Anonymous itself, thus posing a challenge to even this emergent order.
It is rare for something actually resembling the trickster
myth to come into being in the midst of our contemporary
reality, much less with such panache and public presence.
These hackers, in their sacrifice (and sacrifice of others),
served to remind many of the necessity, pleasure, and danger
of subversion.
The awe many felt toward Anonymous and LulzSec can be
illuminated by Walter Benjamin’s insight regarding the great
criminal who, “however repellent his ends may have been, has
aroused the secret admiration of the public.”26 This admiration stems from the fact that criminality reveals the limits of
the state’s monopoly on violence and the force of the law. But
LulzSec and Anonymous fundamentally exceeded the frame
of criminality—even if they were unable to entirely escape its
orbit. LulzSec and Anonymous, in contrast to criminal outfits,
were not out for private gain, and in the case of Anonymous,
there has been significant social pressure to mute self-interest,
personal fame, and recognition. Anonymous performed the
broader, Nietzschean lesson embodied in Zarathustra: to act
out the secret desire to cast off—at least momentarily—the
shackles of normativity and attain greatness—the will to power
set to collectivist and altruistic goals rather then self-interested
and individualistic desires. Anonymous and LulzSec’s artistic
chaos, to paraphrase Nietzsche, gave birth to a dancing star.
If you think I am overtly romantic about LulzSec and this era
of Anonymous, you may be right. But the events that followed
ensured this honeymoon phase was shortlived. We can now
turn to the death of LulzSec and the rise of AntiSec, and see
how this stunning mythos went awry when Anonymous was
partially eclipsed by a cult of personality.
LulzSec 275
chapter 9
AntiSec
One day in February 2011, a twenty-six-year-old
Chicago hacker logged onto the AnonOps IRC server
and said to himself, “Now here is a productive conversation.” Anonymous was in the midst of targeting the notorious
Koch brothers, major donors to Wisconsin’s Republican governor, Scott Walker. That frigid winter, activists all over the
state had marched from the farms and factories into the state’s
capitol in protest of Governor Walker, who was pushing for
a bill that would strip away state employees’ rights to collective bargaining. This hacker watched as Anonymous DDoSed
the Koch-funded free-market advocacy group Americans for
Prosperity.
It was also frigid in Chicago. Whirling around corners and
howling down corridors, the powerful winter wind gripped the
city. This hacker, Jeremy Hammond, had barely been logged
on for twenty minutes before losing his Internet connection.
He sighed and pulled his six-foot, lanky body from his chair
and shuffled outside. He stood on the back stoop, his fingers
numb from the cold, as he desperately tried to adjust the Wi-Fi
antenna. His laptop sat connected to the antenna, running
“aircrack-ng,” which was busy doing its best to break into his
neighbor’s wireless network. Hammond stood still. He knew
that even the most minor movement could affect the wireless 
278 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
signal. It was 3 am, and he was freezing. Going inside wouldn’t
help; there hadn’t been heat in the house for months. With the
Internet connection finally reestablished, he returned to IRC,
and was bathed in the blue light from his laptop for hours.
As Hammond read everything he could about Anonymous’s
latest activist jaunts, something tugged at his soul. He identified with Anonymous and he wanted to be a part of it.
Hammond was a fiery political activist; without a doubt he
was—and remains—one of the most prolific, adamant, unwavering American hacktivists to have ever typed on a keyboard.
By his early twenties, direct action had already become a way
of life; between the ages of eighteen and twenty-eight, he was
arrested eight times during political protests. At the 2004
Republican National Convention, held in New York City, he
was scooped up during a drum-banging protest; the following
year, he rallied against a neo-Nazi group in Toledo, Ohio, and
was arrested for violating an injunction preventing street protests. More recently, in 2010, after burning an Olympic banner
to protest Chicago’s bid for the 2016 games, he was sentenced
to eighteen months’ probation and 130 hours of community
service. Hammond proudly calls himself an anarchist because
he believes passionately in “leaderless collectives based on
free association, consensus, mutual aid, self-sufficiency, and
harmony with the environment.”1
By summer 2011, with the snow long gone, he was actively
compromising servers and websites for political purposes. It
was fateful for him, for a little more than a year later he would
be under arrest and headed toward a decade-long sentence in
federal prison. Hammond told me about both his previous
hacktivism and involvement with Anonymous in September
2013, during our first, and only, face-to-face meeting, at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City where he
was locked up awaiting sentencing. After his arrest in March
2012, we had communicated through old-fashioned paper
and stamped envelopes (Hammond placed his stamps upside
down). When I met him, he was wearing an oversized brown 
canvas jumpsuit draped over a body that no longer bore the
lanky traces of his programming past. His bulging forearms—
the most visible indication of the sixty pounds of muscle
he had acquired in prison—rested on a brown table in the
barren detainee meeting room. A soundtrack was provided by
the buzzing and clicking of the fluorescent lights, their glare
bouncing off the white cinder blocks. Having already sucked
all aesthetic warmth from the room, the administrators found
a way to make it even worse—by making it freezing.
In this delightful ambiance, as Hammond told me more and
more about his past, it became increasingly clear that his technical skills had been sharpened specifically for their political
capabilities.
Growing up with his twin brother and father in the immediate
outskirts of Chicago, he was barely out of the crib when he
began toying with computer games. By age ten, he graduated
to programming his own games in QBasic on a black-andwhite 10MHz laptop with MS-DOS6 and Windows 3.1. He
got online soon after, setting up an IRC channel for game
development. He also discovered and devoured hacker literary genres, like textfiles (also known as philes) and zines.
Typically, these texts, “which teach the techniques and ethos
of the underground,” as Bruce Sterling notes, “are prized reservoirs of forbidden knowledge.”2

Hammond ate this material up and (incorrectly) assumed that
most other hackers shared his political sensibilities. It wasn’t
until high school, when he started to attend the local 2600
meetings, that he experienced a bit of a rude awakening. He
remembers most of the participants as “super white hats”
whose politics lay nowhere near his nascent anticapitalist sensibilities. But, because he also self-identified as a hacker, he
enjoyed attending these meetings. He saw the utility of learning from these people.
And then, as he explained, he was further politicized a little
later, when “Bush stole the election, 9/11 happened, and the
Patriot Act was passed.” At the age of twenty, he cofounded
a radical website called Hack This Site with a corollary zine
called Hack This Zine. This titles riff off Steal This Book, the
1960s counterculture manual-manifesto written by Abbie
Hoffman. (The Yippies published the first hacker/phreak zine,
The Youth International Party Line, which advocated ripping
off AT&T, aka “Ma Bell,” as a revolutionary act. Its successor
publication, Technical Assistance Program (TAP), would shed
the overtly leftist political rhetoric.) Hack This Site covered
computer security but also delved into radical political trends
and events from around the globe, like the movement against
the war in Afghanistan and the potential threats to democracy
posed by computer-based voting machines.
Even if Hammond was an anomaly in the American hacker
scene, there were enough kindred souls around the globe to
constitute a small, but feisty, band of radical tech warriors.
His zine helped breed a cohort of left-leaning hackers. In fact,
one of LulzSec’s most politically minded hackers, Donncha
O’Cearbhaill, aka Palladium, had been a reader before he and
Hammond met online. And when Hammond wasn’t writing
for the zine, he was channeling his technical skills more directly
toward his political goals. 
In the course of one of his earliest hacks, before he was
involved in Anonymous—indeed, before Anonymous even
existed as a name to channel activist causes—Hammond left
the image of Guy Fawkes on a defaced website. As he briefly
touched upon his Guy Fawkes defacement and described his
love of the film V for Vendetta, his blue eyes sparkled, his
otherwise pale face came to life, and the austere room seemed
to soften. I prodded him for more details.
It was March 2006, only a year after he started to hack
politically. He had teamed up with The BrigadaElectronica,
a loose association of radical anonymous hackers. This coalition hacked into the websites of the Philippine National Police,
the Malacañang Palace (the official residence of the Philippine
president), the Office of the President of the Philippines, and
the National Defense College of the Philippines in a show of
solidarity with the Sagada 11, a cohort of activists, including a few volunteering with Food Not Bombs who had been
detained in the northern Filipino province of Luzon and faced
charges of terrorism.4 (Food Not Bombs is an association of
radical collectives serving vegan and vegetarian food to the
hungry.)
Hammond wasn’t the only budding anarchist fond of the
Hollywood blockbuster V for Vendetta, released the same
month as his hack in support of the Sagada 11. The film’s
antihero dons a Guy Fawkes mask. Fawkes was once primarily known as a sort of mascot for seventeenth-century
British regicide. His failed attempts at regicide are commemorated to this day in the form of a British holiday bearing
his name, which celebrates the continuity of the monarchy
through the widespread burning of bonfires. British writer
Alan Moore adopted the mythologized figure into a dystopian comic book, which became a Hollywood film, which led
to the reimagining of Fawkes’s visage as that of the quintessential terrorist-turned-icon-of-resistance. Even if all symbols
are open to interpretation, some are more elastic than others.
While the peace symbol can only signify one single position,
AntiSec 281
282 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
this silent smiling man has, over the years, accrued a multiplicity of meanings before coming to stand as the face of
popular dissent.
Soon after his first forays into political hacking, Hammond
was arrested and detained in federal prison between 2006 and
2008. He had digitally infiltrated a right-wing organization
called “Protest Warrior,” whose tag line is “Fighting the Left,
Doing it Right”; he pilfered credit card information from their
site’s database. Since he never used the credit card information,
he was only charged for the computer intrusion, escaping the
harsher sentence and fines that often attend fraudulent credit
card use (the prosecutor was seeking a five-year jail term in addition to a $2.5 million fine, saying, “While Jeremy Hammond
tried to make this about politics, we wanted to make this about
what actually occurred, that he stole credit cards”).5
 Sentenced
to twenty-four months in jail and fined $5,358, he was sent to
a medium-security prison and served eighteen months.
During our interview he offered a surprising confession. In
2008, as Anonymous began adopting the Guy Fawkes mask
he adored, he was initially repelled by the group. He dismissed
Anonymous as “script kiddies” (a derogatory term for a technologist lacking real skills) and found the “anything goes”
culture of deviant trolling—which crossed the line into racism
at times—“alienating.” But these were minor reasons compared
to his broader rejection of hacktivism more generally. After a
few years of political hacking, and two years in jail for the
effort, he had asked himself whether “as an environmentalist
… [he] was supporting the industrial beast with technology.”
For a period he answered “yes,” and he backed away.
But with the emergence of WikiLeaks, and the leaks provided
by Manning in particular, he saw the potential of technology
“to expose crime.” At his sentencing, following his hacking
stint for Anonymous, he would pay tribute to Manning: “She
took an enormous personal risk to leak this information—
believing that the public had a right to know and hoping that
her disclosures would be a positive step to end these abuses. 
It is heart-wrenching to hear about her cruel treatment in
military lockup.”
Hammond warmed to Anonymous early in 2011. He joined
AnonOps during OpWisconsin but remained largely a spectator. As he learned the ropes, he also started to establish
connections with others. On June 21, 2011, Hammond finally
took the full plunge. He first approached Sabu and wanted to
hand over some material but, after failing to connect with him,
instead sent a private message to two members of LulzSec, first
to Topiary and then to tflow, offering to offload some “candiez”
that were in his possession. Hammond had recently gained
privileged access to the Arizona Department of Public Safety
website and siphoned the data he found there. LulzSec eventually accepted custody of the information and released it in four
batches under the title “Chinga La Migra” (Spanish for “Fuck
the Immigration Police”). It included email messages, names,
phone numbers, home addresses, and passwords belonging
to Arizona law enforcement, alongside operational materials
such as private intelligence bulletins and training manuals.
The timing was perfect. When Hammond handed over the
data, LulzSec was in the midst of a tectonic shift, from Internet
trickster-fabulists to revolutionary militants. They had a new
agenda and a new flag: “AntiSec,” short for Anti-Security.
The shift is difficult to explain. Insiders confirmed that even
for them, this period was mired in chaos. One Anon told me
during an interview: “This was more chaotic in terms of so
many subgroups forming, splintering, and redefining themselves … This was the age of LulzSec, AntiSec, TeaMpOisin,
the A-Team, CabinCr3w, Buccaneers, Panther Moderns, etc.”
Mysteries aside, one thing was certain: over the summer of
2011, Anonymous experienced a Cambrian explosion of hacker
crews. Where previously a single IRC network (AnonOps) and
a breakaway group (LulzSec) dominated the North American
and European scene, an archipelago of hacker islands—with
AntiSec becoming the most visible and notorious of the
bunch—suddenly emerged from the Anonymous waters.

“It’s now or never. Come aboard, we’re expecting you”
In early June 2011, LulzSec was sailing at a fast clip and
leaving behind an extravagant wake for the enjoyment of
other Internet denizens. They didn’t know at the time, but
they were sailing headlong into stormy weather. Seemingly
out of the blue, on June 19, 2011, four days before the Chinga
La Migra release, LulzSec unfurled “Operation AntiSec.” This
operation was announced, true to form, via a press release on
pastebin.com. But there was one key difference: its language.
Featuring only a trace of humor (some bits about lizard blood
and a reference to lyrics from the Love Boat theme song), its
tone was strikingly revolutionary. The release also claimed
something that LulzSec had not claimed before—that the
operation was an Anonymous project:
Welcome to Operation Anti-Security (#AntiSec)—we
encourage any vessel, large or small, to open fire on any government or agency that crosses their path. We fully endorse
the flaunting of the word “AntiSec” on any government
website defacement or physical graffiti art.
Whether you’re sailing with us or against us, whether you
hold past grudges or a burning desire to sink our lone ship,
we invite you to join the rebellion. Together we can defend
ourselves so that our privacy is not overrun by profiteering
gluttons. Your hat can be white, gray or black, your skin and
race are not important. If you’re aware of the corruption,
expose it now, in the name of Anti-Security.
Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government
information, including email spools and documentation.
Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments. If they try to censor our progress, we will obliterate
the censor with cannonfire anointed with lizard blood.
It’s now or never. Come aboard, we’re expecting you.6
Why did Topiary, who wrote the communiqué, push for this
revolutionary stance? All evidence points to Sabu. A few weeks
prior to the publication of the press release, Sabu had clamored online for the revival of an older AntiSec project.
The anti-security movement had briefly flourished at the
turn of the century among some black hat hackers who had
contempt for the security industry in general, and for white
hat hackers in particular. This was a period when increasingly
hackers sought and landed employment in the security industry.
Under the mantle of anti-security, a slice of black hat hackers
targeted security professionals—doxing them, dumping their
mail spools—to protest the increasingly common practice of
publicly disclosing exploits and vulnerabilities. Their reasoning, as offered in a founding document, was as follows:
The purpose of this movement is to encourage a new policy
of anti-disclosure among the computer and network security communities. The goal is not to ultimately discourage
the publication of all security-related news and developments, but rather, to stop the disclosure of all unknown
or non-public exploits and vulnerabilities. In essence, this
would put a stop to the publication of all private materials
that could allow script kiddies from compromising systems
via unknown methods.7
While this statement may sound reasonable, the group’s
actions were aggressively bold. A more recent anti-security
manifesto reflects the mayhem these hackers wrought on the
security industry (see figure overleaf). As odd as it might seem,
part of the motivation behind the original anti-security was
cultural preservation, “to take back the scene.”
The original anti-security vision was a different animal from
the one conceived of by Sabu and Anonymous. While the contemporary Anonymous AntiSec movement held little regard
for white hats and was disgusted at what it saw as flagrant
greed in the security industry, these were not its main enemies.
AntiSec 285

Instead, the AntiSec revival was driven by a more general sense
of justice. The point was to own banks, governments, security
firms, and other corporations in search of politically damning,
leakable information. And, perhaps most crucially of all, the
contemporary manifestation of anti-security did not go about
its business quietly.
LulzSec’s first public mention of AntiSec was on Twitter:
“So gather round, this is a new cyber world and we’re starting

Just three days after this message was posted, on June 7,
2011, at 10:15 pm, the FBI visited a towering brick housing
project called the Jacob Riis Houses in Manhattan’s Lower
East Side. They came to this Puerto Rican stronghold to
arrest Hector Monsegur, aka Sabu. According to a leaked FBI
warrant filed to gain access to Monsegur’s Facebook account,
a corporation previously hacked by Anonymous culled an IP
address that was handed over to law enforcement. The FBI
retrieved subscriber information for the IP address, which
led to Monsegur’s postal and email addresses. The authorities sought access to Monsegur’s Facebook account because
the “pictures” would allow them “to confirm the identity of
the individual who assisted in the unauthorized intrusion” and
possibly also land other leads if Monsegur shared any information on the social media platform with his hacker associates.
Although only twenty-seven years old, he was the foster parent
to his incarcerated aunt’s two girls, then both younger than
eight. Along with his Anonymous/LulzSec activity, the FBI had
evidence linking him to credit card fraud. Facing the prospect
of decades in jail and the loss of his two foster children, he
flipped.
Just four days before his arrest, the LulzSec crew worried
that some of its affiliates had jumped ship. Sabu had claimed
he was going to wipe everything:
<Neuron>: Sabu, did we lose people?
<storm>: agreed
<storm>: did we?
<Sabu>: yeah
<storm>: who?
<Sabu>: recursion and devurandom quit respectfully
<Sabu>: saying they are not up for the heat
<Neuron>: im already wiping my enitre desktop
[…]
AntiSec 287
288 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Sabu>: yeah
<Sabu>: wipe it all
<Sabu>: im wiping all my shit now
Whatever he did or didn’t do then, Sabu went from radical
hacktivist to sitting in the FBI’s back pocket where he provided a direct portal to LulzSec. The LulzSec team, constantly
online, found Sabu’s twenty-four-hour absence fishy. To test
him upon his return, they asked him to own a server, which
he did, quelling any concerns. Of course, the FBI gave him its
blessing to proceed so he could maintain his cover.
Soon after his arrest, Sabu jacked up the AntiSec rhetoric
previously hinted at in one brief Twitter message. He must
have known that Hammond would find it enticing. Hammond
would have likely been on the FBI’s radar, being one of the
only anarchists and hackers in the United States who had
already served time in jail. The rhetorical shift marked by
AntiSec could just as easily have been a continuation of a
sincere commitment. We may never know. But what we do
know is that Sabu, just shortly after being flipped, pushed for
the AntiSec press release to feature charged political language,
and Topiary willingly wrote it. Topiary explained to me via
email that
Sabu was highly interested in my writing of this message,
but perhaps more so he was infatuated with LulzSec’s atthe-time follower count on twitter and saw it as a platform
from which to push this kind of political stance. At the time
it seemed no more than misguided angsty teenage performance art, but of course to others it was taken with a far
more serious flavour.
The public, journalists, and Anonymous itself were all unaware
that the FBI had Sabu on a tight leash. But everyone noticed
just how much the press release diverged from LulzSec’s style.
Media outlets from AdBusters to Fox News reported on the 
press release, with about half a dozen reporters pulling it apart
to try and figure out what was going on. Stephen Chapman
from ZDNet posed the key question:
What has existed up to this point as an aimless objective
consisting of a series of random, pointless targets, is now
coming together as a full-fledged anti-government/antiestablishment movement of potentially epic proportions.
Has the digital revolution finally started—something we’ve
been watching Hollywood play out for years now? Perhaps.9
Everyone was wondering, including myself, if this was yet
another joke or the expression of a true sentiment.
The following day, LulzSec answered. They made good on
Operation AntiSec’s promise by using Ryan Cleary’s botnet
to DDoS Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. The very
next day, on June 21, law enforcement arrested Cleary at his
residence in Essex, just outside of London. Newspapers across
England were awash with dozens of images of the young man,
a core AnonOps hacker and a LulzSec affiliate. As portrayed
in the news, he conformed to the stereotype of a dysfunctional,
isolated young male. Chubby with milky white skin, he rarely
left his bedroom which, while not technically a basement, certainly resembled one, since every window was blocked with
homemade silver-foil window blackout. The British tabloids
did not miss a beat in sensationalizing every detail.
It was in this frenetic milieu that Hammond reached out to
LulzSec with his Arizona material. He had originally wanted to
give the data to Sabu, but Sabu was suddenly, and oddly, unresponsive to his queries. Seemingly kindred spirits, Hammond
and Sabu had bonded over a shared goal of uniting disparate
black hats to rally against injustice and oppression.
So Hammond, operating under the name “Anarchaos,” privately messaged Topiary and tflow, emphasizing that he did
not want to “touch the torrent seed server with a ten feet pole.”
tflow happily took the “candiez” and LulzSec immediately
AntiSec 289
290 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
pushed the material online, listing it on the Pirate Bay’s torrent
servers on June 23. Hammond had not earned the trust of
the core LulzSec hackers and was not allowed to enter their
private chambers. But his hack provided the catalyst through
which the AntiSec vision became deed. Hammond wrote the
Chinga La Migra press release himself:
We are releasing hundreds of private intelligence bulletins,
training manuals, personal email correspondence, names,
phone numbes, addresses and passwords belonging to
Arizona law enforcement. We are targeting AZDPS specifically because we are against SB1070 and the racial profiling
anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona.
The documents classified as “law enforcement sensitive,”
“not for public distribution,” and “for official use only” are
primarily related to border patrol and counter-terrorism
operations and describe the use of informants to infiltrate
various gangs, cartels, motorcycle clubs, Nazi groups, and
protest movements.
[…]
Hackers of the world are uniting and taking direct action
against our common oppressors—the government, corporations, police, and militaries of the world. See you again real
soon! ;D10
Soon after the Chinga La Migra release, Hammond, still
on probation for his previous hack, was paid a visit by the
Chicago police and FBI for a probation check. He found it odd
that for a routine check an FBI agent had joined the probation
officer. “When they discovered K2 [synthetic marijuana], they
put state charges on me for felony possession of marijuana,
charges I beat when the drug results came back,” explained
Hammond. In jail for a few weeks, Hammond was not around
to witness the controversy that his dump stirred among the
LulzSec crew. A number of them, such as tflow, pwnsauce,
and later Topiary, regretted their decision to release the data. 
Although these young men had previously doxed a whole
batch of corporate executives and released other, equally sensitive data, targeting police officers felt riskier. This territory,
while familiar to Hammond, was unfamiliar to them.
In fact, tflow, who was sixteen years old at the time, encouraged the crew to disband LulzSec. It had only been alive for
fifty days, but that is a lifetime on the Internet. Surprisingly,
everyone, even Sabu, initially agreed. But then, without
warning, Sabu changed his mind. tflow explained it to me:
“In the fallout he was just outraged that we all wanted to
quit despite him not wanting us to and he generally gets what
he wants through manipulation.” Ryan Ackroyd (aka Kayla)
also recalled one of Sabu’s more manipulative—and deeply
ironic—tactics: “I remember him saying something like (not
word for word) something about him risking his kids coming
this far and stuff and that it was unfair to give up.”
Despite Sabu’s exhortations, tflow’s camp ultimately prevailed. LulzSec retired at the end of June 2011. Of course,
they couldn’t help but go out in style, and so on June 25 they
unveiled a final mega-release, including the text of an internal
AOL networking manual, half a gigabyte of AT&T internal
data, and the emails, usernames, and encrypted user passwords
for sites ranging from HackForums.net to NATO’s online
book shop. Even more interesting than the data itself—at
least from the perspective of trickery and myth-making—was
LulzSec’s final statement, again drafted by Topiary:
For the past 50 days we’ve been disrupting and exposing
corporations, governments, often the general population
itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because
we could. All to selflessly entertain others—vanity, fame, recognition, all of these things are shadowed by our desire for
that which we all love. The raw, uninterrupted, chaotic thrill
of entertainment and anarchy. It’s what we all crave, even
the seemingly lifeless politicians and emotionless, middleaged self-titled failures.11
AntiSec 291
292 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
The press release passed the LulzSec mantle to the nascent
AntiSec movement. These hackers wanted, as tflow put it to
me, LulzSec’s “legacy of hacks to continue.” The final statement continues:
behind the mask, behind the insanity and mayhem, we truly
believe in the AntiSec movement. We believe in it so strongly
that we brought it back, much to the dismay of those looking
for more anarchic lulz. We hope, wish, even beg, that the
movement manifests itself into a revolution that can continue on without us … Please don’t stop. Together, united,
we can stomp down our common oppressors and imbue
ourselves with the power and freedom we deserve.
In jail, Hammond counted down the days until he could return
to his newfound community of uber-political hackers. Upon
release, he was, as he put it to me, “ready to rock again.” He
had no trouble finding willing comrades.
Still, AntiSec’s future success was uncertain until three
factors converged. First, Sabu, now working full time as
an informant, made it his personal mission to keep AntiSec
afloat. Second, Hammond functioned as the perfect confederate. A talented hacker who believed in the AntiSec mission, he
became its unflagging workhorse, eventually dedicating most
of his free time to the project. The third crucial factor was the
existence of a broader team. Despite some LulzSec members
having bid permanent adieu a number of them joined the new
team. The fully constituted AntiSec crew would consist of
roughly eight to twelve core participants—larger than LulzSec
ever was. Composed of hackers and a few strategists, the team
ensconced itself on a secret channel (with the not-so-secret
name “#antisec”) on a server called “cryto.” Many had previously collaborated during the Arab and African Spring ops. I
myself knew a number of them from this period, when I hung
out on #freedommods, one of the invite-only social channels
for the revolutionary ops.
Sabu, so often pegged as the leader of AntiSec, did not
actually mastermind the operations or bark orders (in fact,
he seemed quite scattered during this period, although later
we will see that he went to Hammond with specific hacking
requests). The entire AntiSec core team would sometimes
work in unison, but more typically they splintered into
smaller groups for different operations. For instance, a spinoff channel was created for the hack against the security firm
ManTech. Some of the breakaway operations never included
Sabu, and his contributions were rarely technical.
Still, Sabu played two vital roles. He was the point man
for most exploits and intelligence passed to the team, and
he became its public face. Whereas Topiary functioned as a
trickster in his handling of PR for LulzSec, Sabu functioned
for AntiSec as a seemingly authentic stable representative.
Take the following tweet from June 20, a few weeks after
his arrest: “Operation Anti-Security: pastebin.com/9KyA0E5v–
The Biggest, unified operation amongst hackers in history. All
factions welcome. We are one.”
A few members of AntiSec also encouraged Sabu to take
on a separate, public profile as an individual. Influenced both
by AntiSec’s prodding and direct pressure from the FBI, that
summer Sabu used Twitter with full force, launching a stream
of spitfire revolutionary rhetoric. Wielding his charisma, he
acquired a cult-like status. With the demise of LulzSec, the
mythic tricksters were gone. And while Sabu certainly became
mythical, his style of public presentation was by no means
that of a trickster. He occupied, instead, the archetypal role
of revolutionary hacker outlaw. In the lead-up to this period,
I had largely avoided him. But finally, in the middle of the
summer, as he rose to prominence, I decided it was about time
I reached out.
AntiSec 293

Sabu
It was American Independence Day: July 4, 2011. Sitting in
a boiling room with no air conditioner in San Juan, Puerto
Rico—the city where I grew up—I struggled to finish reading
an interview with Sabu (the first with this notorious hacker)
as beads of sweat trickled down my forehead.
12
Conducted by Samantha Murphy for the New Scientist, the
piece offered the first public interview with Sabu. I was feeling
lame because I, one of the world’s experts on Anonymous,
had not even managed a single conversation with the kingpin
himself. I had kept my distance from him because, to be frank, I
found him intimidating. His disposition was not exactly warm
and fuzzy. Prior to being flipped, he had kept a much lower
online profile, and he exuded a sort of badass revolutionary
attitude; he wasn’t someone you simply chatted with. Sabu’s
calls for people to rise up were routinely directed towards
his “brothers” and “sisters.” During chats on IRC, he would
drop the word “nigger” and, unlike the trolls, he seemed to be
using it without a hint of irony. Instead of a rich, alienated,
white, basement-dwelling teenager, Sabu sounded like a streethardened brother. Was it possible that his alienation and anger
were borne not of middle-class anomie, but instead of poverty,
racial marginalization, and torn families?
The interview recounted a 1999 escapade in which Sabu
defaced websites in an effort to call for the end of the US
military presence on the small Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
Done with the piece, I worked up the courage to send him a
private message:
<biella>: hey Sabu just wanted to say props to your work in Vieques
<biella>: I am from la isla and was quite involved with environmental
politics back in the day
I waited for what felt like an eternity for his response. To me,
it seemed like the world had stopped, the sweat drops freezing 
halfway down my back. But in reality, he responded almost
immediately:
<Sabu>: nice
Then:
<Sabu>: so whats your goal? I see your name associated with being
fed/sntich/writing docs on anonymous
<Sabu>: tell me your true intentions
<Sabu>: I am interested
My thoughts swirled. In a scene where reputation counts for
so much, Sabu’s intimation stung. I now understand that his
accusation was a smart move; he erected a frame that would
make it hard for me to see him as a possible snitch. At the
time, I could not even fathom that he might be working for
the FBI. The question of how I might fend off his accusations
eclipsed any other consideration:
<biella>: Sabu I am just an anthropologist
A millisecond after typing, I realized how stupid that probably
sounded. Anyone with a basic knowledge of snitches knows
that there is a well-documented history of anthropologists
working as covert CIA agents. I tried to regroup:
<biella>: I fell into Anonymous accidentally back in 2008
<biella>: via Scientology
<Sabu>: ok
That did not seem good enough either:
<biella>: my passion is politics
<biella>: so I like to study the politics of digital media
<Sabu>: I understand that
AntiSec 295
296 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
And then I said something that now makes me cringe:
<biella>: in terms of anon, I am intrigued and am also concerned (FBI,
my computer etc)
<biella>: I take precautions with my data, dont collect certain types
of data either, which is frustrating but the only way I see around this
<sabu>: well whats your point of collecting data?
<biella>: I am bummed to hear that my name is associated with
snitch/FBI but I understand in so far as it is part of the territory
<Sabu>: historical?
<Sabu>: social science research?
<biella>: I would say a combo of both those
I explained that I did not want to uncover “crimes.” Rather,
I was interested in understanding social dynamics. Although
our first conversation went rather poorly, much to my surprise—and relief—our chatting became both more regular and
friendlier. I thought that either I’d convinced him of my noble
intentions, or he had asked other AntiSec members about me.
By this time, I was certain that informants were implanted in
AnonOps, but in June and July very few rumors tagged Sabu
as a rat, whereas other core Anonymous members were often
plagued by accusations. My conversations with Sabu only
fueled my paranoia. On July 23 he asked:
<Sabu>: you’re deep into anonymous channels and comms
<Sabu>: you never get visits from feds?
<biella>: not yet
<biella>: i have neither been stopped at the border though i travel
without my main computer or no computer, not that i have anything
incriminating
<biella>: i worry about this, i have contacts with the EFF [Electronic
Frontier Foundation]
Much like my first conversation with Sabu, when I praised
him in the hopes that he would talk to me, he instead began to
butter me up, even thanking me:
<Sabu>: for all the work you do
<Sabu>: en serio mucho respeto [seriously, much respect]
<Sabu>: at the end of the day this movement can be amazing
He also started dropping hints that the FBI was watching me:
<Sabu>: … just because you’re legit doesnt mean they’re not following you
He was clever: I was the potential problem, not him. He
would point this out repeatedly and then continue on with his
revolutionary rhetoric. He made it hard to see him as anything
other than a passionate activist, unwaveringly committed to
the cause.
The Pleasures of Secrecy
A few weeks after my first conversation with Sabu, I was
invited to a secret IRC channel for a one-time conversation
among AntiSec members. The participants included a handful
of IRC operators from AnonOps and Emmanuel Goldstein,
the publisher of hacker zine 2600 and host of a hacker radio
show called Off the Hook. They convened to gauge whether
Goldstein would be interested in lending his support to the
AntiSec subproject oriented around propaganda and artistic creation, called “voice.” Here I was, invited to the inner
sanctum. I watched intensely as the group of roughly twenty
participants debated the merits of direct action and the
purpose of the voice project.
Sabu set the agenda: “so gentlemen we’re going to bring
in Emmanuel. He’s going to be the voice of anonymous and
antisec on the radio and really wants to help push #voice over.”
As it turned out, Goldstein had made no such promises, and
while many seemed open to his participation, others objected
immediately. Some accused him of being a snitch. Now, one
AntiSec 297
298 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
must understand that rumors of snitching constitute part of
the everyday background noise among hackers, and this noise
itself becomes one of the main roadblocks against substantiating the claims. During the chat, a critic noted that “2600 has
a history of condemning attacks, including when Anonymous
ddosed mastercard and others for wikileaks.”
Adrian Lamo, the hacker who snitched on Chelsea Manning,
had at one point been active in the 2600 scene, with access to
an account on 2600’s mail/shell server. According to some,
Lamo had not been sufficiently purged. Many were upset
about these things, as well as about the Hackers on Planet
Earth (HOPE) convention, organized by Goldstein and a large
team, which featured Lamo on a panel.
I was particularity intrigued by what a figure named
Anarchaos was writing in the chat room. He wasn’t anyone
I had seen online before, and it would still be another few
months before I would converse with him for the first time,
under a different handle. Goldstein began questioning tactics
like DDoSing and street-based black bloc organizing, and
Anarchaos staunchly defended their legitimacy. “I’ve got personal and political reasons for taking direct action against
the forces that oppress us. Don’t be thinking those that fight
with force aren’t doing it with brains.” Anons on the channel
admitted that “we are more than capable of higher sophisticated attacks but regardless, when we are in the trenches
firing upon our enemies, we don’t need other so-called
hackers to be undermining our efforts.” Later, someone added
that “a diversity of tactics is the most effective way to win
campaigns.”
What started as a fascinating conversation about diversity
of tactics quickly burst into a flame fest. At a certain point,
someone asked Goldstein whether he had ever met me (he
had not). I used the attention suddenly directed my way to
share with him my thoughts on the HOPE panel that included
Adrian Lamo. I wrote that it was “mind blowing,” and that I
was “glad you organized that.” 
“You wouldn’t believe the pressure I was under NOT to
do that,” replied Goldstein. Some in the chat room took the
opportunity to affirm that they were still pissed: “Lamo should
not be welcome at any hacker gathering and just another nail
in the coffin for many people to write off 2600 as sellouts.”
The conversation briefly returned to whether 2600 could
contribute to the voice project, before devolving into “lame-ass
flaming,” as one participant put it. Goldstein decided to exit:
“sorry to cause a bitter tone in here so I will split. But we’re
open to dialogue.” The voice project launched soon after on
a public IRC channel, without Goldstein’s help. Though the
mission of the meeting had failed, it did confirm what I had
suspected: the AntiSec team contained a number of hackers,
like Anarchaos, who were active but hidden. Who were these
people? Why had I never seen them before? The core LulzSec
participants, like Topiary, tflow, and Sabu, were for the
most part well-known figures. It was clear that Anonymous,
already so elusive, was blanketed under even more layers of
secrecy.
And, increasingly, I was also being swept into this orbit of
secrecy. I had tried to keep my distance from channels where
illegal activity was organized. When I talked to Anons privately, I frequently requested that they spare incriminating
details (knowing that they might be itching to brag about
some epic security compromise). I made it clear to everyone
that my role as an anthropologist meant that I was often
taking notes, saving some portion of logs, and otherwise gathering data. Even though I encrypted my data, I maintained no
special privilege that would preclude me from being regarded
as an accessory to crime. As a result, I was not invited to secret
channels and I (mostly) avoided the boastful stories about
illicit hacks. My attitude was also plainly honest, and I think
this helped people understand just what it was I was up to—a
rarity in a culture of mistrust, suspicion, rumors, and fear.
But now things seemed to be changing. I was slipping into
deeper, darker recesses of this labyrinth, given fleeting access
AntiSec 299
300 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
to private conversations, and becoming increasingly worried
that this could devolve into a problem.
Aldous Huxley once wrote: “To associate with other likeminded people in small, purposeful groups is for the great
majority of men and women a source of profound psychological satisfaction. Exclusiveness will add to the pleasure of
being several, but at one; and secrecy will intensify it almost
to ecstasy.”13 For the hackers participating in Anonymous,
secrecy was, without a doubt, a major source of what kept
them coming back for more. Secrecy provided a sort of sustenance for this underground community. And while “ecstasy”
might be too strong a word when applied to my case, I can’t
deny it: acceptance into this esoteric society gave me a thrilling contact high.
Where Art Thou, Anonymous?
As exciting as it initially was to stand in the shadows with
Anonymous, by early August 2011, my mood had soured. The
frenetic pace of Anonymous activity had mutated into something new through the sheer militancy of the operations. I began
to wonder when the FBI or another government agency was
going to nab more Anons, or even pay me a visit. AntiSec, like
LulzSec, had settled into a rhythm of near-constant hacking,
generating taunting releases that simply begged for a reaction
from the state: #FuckFBIFridays, #ShootingSherrifsSaturday,
#MilitaryMeltdownMonday.
AntiSec doxed sheriff’s offices, defaced and destroyed police
organization websites like that of the California Statewide Law
Enforcement Association, and leaked the personal information of New York police chiefs. In July alone they attacked the
websites of seventy-seven different law enforcement agencies
(all hosted on the same server). They dumped a gigabyte of data
from Vanguard Defense Industries acquired by hacking the
email account of one of its senior vice-presidents. They revealed 
to the world documents that they had “procured,” including a
proposal to the FBI from defense contractor IRC Federal for
a project called the “Special Identities Modernization (SIM)
Project,” which aimed to identify people who “might” present
a criminal or terrorist risk in the future. They claimed to have
infiltrated various internal networks of the US Department of
Energy, where they sent messages urging employees to work
against the government rather than for it. They hacked the
federal contractor ManTech International, publishing over
four hundred megabytes of content that detailed its dealings
with NATO and the US Army (alongside all its employees’
emails). They struck at the mega-security contractor Booz
Allen Hamilton; while they were unable to obtain actual
documents—though one of Booz Allen Hamilton’s employees at the time, Edward Snowden, eventually would—they
managed to download ninety thousand military emails from
the company’s site, which they threw up on the Pirate Bay with
a long analysis noting “key facts” about the company, such as
its funding breakdown. Things had taken a very serious turn.
During this surge of activity, arrests became more commonplace. By the end of July, fourteen Americans had been arrested
for DDoSing PayPal, and British authorities had arrested two
members of LulzSec: Topiary in Scotland and tflow in London
(tflow’s name was not released at the time because he was
still a minor). Right before Topiary’s arrest, he left behind an
adage—it now stands alone on his retired Twitter account:
“You cannot arrest an idea.”14
It was a hot summer. In this climate of menace and threat,
I began to suffer weekly nightmares of G-men pounding on
my door. I asked myself just what the hell I had gotten myself
involved in, and I wasn’t the only one. During an interview,
one Anon expressed surprise: “None of us knew we’d be here
… locked up for decades, on the run, in exile, suicides mental
illness ptsd [sic] etc etc.” Anons increasingly reached out to me
with confessions of fear, fueling my own growing unease. On
August 1, someone found me and wrote that “shit is getting
AntiSec 301
302 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
EXTREMELY hot atm [at the moment] … for those who do
AntiSec for instance.” The next day, another hacker told me, “I
had helicopter land in a field next to me at 7 am this morning.
My heart rate hit about 200, till I realized it was crop spraying.” Between the people freaking out to me in private, the
litany of arrests, my life being put on hold as I poured increasing amounts of time into the research, the highly mediated
text-based pseudonymous interactivity, and the growing tentacles of secrecy, I grew frustrated and burnt out. It was getting
to me. I was worried about the future of Anonymous, about
my future and the lives of those who had been arrested. Some
hackers in AntiSec started to notice that I was down. Some
contacted me privately, encouraging me not to quit. One told
me that if I quit I would miss some really “special things.”
I didn’t even bother to ask what these things might
be. The leaks and compromises were still going strong,
but they had lost their luster. To me, #FuckFBIFridays
and #MilitaryMeltdownMonday had started to become
#FuckFBIFatigue and #MyMeltdownMondays. I was also
frustrated that, while my access to AntiSec grew, more activity
seemed to be emanating from other, small hacker teams that I
remained largely in the dark about it. The days of large-scale
Anonymous uprisings were being eclipsed. Anonymous had
been exciting to me for a specific reason: it was the largest and
most populist disruptive grassroots movement the Internet
had, up to that time, fomented. But it felt, suddenly, like
AnonOps/Anonymous was slipping into a more familiar state
of hacker-vangaurdism. And it meant, from a purely logistical perspective, that Anonymous was becoming even harder
to study.
In retrospect, there’s at least one concrete explanation for
Anonymous’s growing fragmentation: direct government
interference. Thanks to Edward Snowden’s NSA mega-leaks
in 2013, we know that in the summer of 2011, Britain’s
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) targeted AnonOps’ communications infrastructure. A GCHQ 
special unit called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence
Group (JTRIG)—which also engages in COINTELPROtype meddling—launched DDoS attacks against Anonymous,
calling it them “OpWealth” and “Rolling Thunder.”15
This was the first known instance of a Western government
secretly using DDoS—criminalized in the UK and the US—as
a tactic against its own citizens. GCHQ claimed that its operation was a success; the leaked slides boast that as a result of
its DDoS of AnonOps’ IRC, “80% of those messaged where
[sic] not in the IRC channels 1 month later.” By this time, the
UK government had already arrested British participants for
the same act. One of those arrested, Chris Weatherhead, aka
“Nerdo,” was a central and much beloved AnonOps operator.
Eventually, he would receive an eighteen-month sentence for
his role in the DDoS campaign “Avenge Assange/Operation
Payback.” He was not found guilty of engaging in an actual
DDoS itself, but of aiding in the operation by running the
IRC server. The British government, on the other hand, has
faced no sanction for DDoSing activists. The law, clearly, is
not applied equally. As Weatherhead put it on Twitter when he
read the news: “My Government used a DDoS attack against
servers I owned, and then convicted me of conducted DDoS
attacks. Seriously what the fucking fuck?”16
This shotgun approach to justice sprays its punishment
over thousands of individuals who are engaging in debate
and protest, simply because a small handful of people in their
midst have committed digital vandalism.
This attempted deterrence may have stalled Anonymous at
large, but it did nothing to stop AntiSec. They were on a different IRC network. While some members did get arrested,
and others left for a variety of reasons, the consensus was
largely that, as one member of AntiSec told me, “there is no
turning back.”
I had to take a break. I booked a trip to one of the most famous
hacker conferences in the world, The Chaos Communication
Camp, organized by the Chaos Computer Club every four
AntiSec 303
304 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
years in Germany. I reasoned that some offline time spent with
hackers I knew, with friends—or at least with people I could
actually look at—might lessen the vertigo that had set in.
Yet after a string of days and nights at the hacker festival
and an early morning flight from Germany, I arrived back in
the United States more exhausted than before I had left. The
Anonymous spirit, by contrast, seemed to have been refreshed.
Making my way through baggage claim, I glimpsed a familiar
image on a faraway TV screen—the Guy Fawkes mask. Jolted,
I trotted over to the monitor. CNN was showing a tweet calling
for “OpBART” (“BART” stands for Bay Area Rapid Transit).
From the visual clues provided by CNN, I realized that this
operation was not only big. It also seemed to fit the mold
of the old-school, tumultuous, large-scale-uprising of the preAntiSec Anonymous. The 80 percent of users the GCHQ had
supposedly blasted away with its DDoS were back, along with
hundreds of newcomers.
OpBART’s point of origin can be pinpointed to July 3,
2011, when BART police fatally shot Charles Hill in the San
Francisco Civic Center BART station. Though the man had
been intoxicated and armed with a knife, killing him struck
many as an excessive use of force. It was also a reminder of
the general problem of police brutality. In 2009, cops had
killed an African-American man, Oscar Grant III, at the
Fruitvale BART Station in Oakland. He was shot in the back
while they had him pinned to the ground. In response to
the shooting of Hill, local organizers coordinated a protest
on July 11. Roughly one hundred demonstrators disrupted
BART service at the Civic Center BART station. Organizers
called for another protest at the Civic Center BART station
one month later. BART officials decided to block cellphone
reception in stations to thwart the August demonstration.
BART spokesperson Linton Johnson explained their rationale to CNN: “We made a gut-wrenching decision that was
forced upon us by the protesters … They [the activists]
made us choose between people’s ability to use their mobile 
phones [and] their constitutional right to get from point A to
point B.”17
Last time I checked, the Constitution protects both free
speech and freedom of association, but not freedom of
transportation. Anonymous geeks, so well acquainted with
constitutional rights, naturally got upset. Jackal, the main
holder of the @YourAnonNews Twitter account, publicly
inaugurated #OPBART with a string of scathing messages. He
had over 300,000 followers, and soon after being featured on
CNN, the account would amass another 200,000 (which also
prompted the FBI to visit Jackal). Anonymous and other concerned citizens relied on the clever hashtag “#muBARTec” to
connect this act of censorship to the wide-scale telecom blackout imposed by former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
just a handful of months earlier, in January 2011.
Jackal was working with a small team. He maintained a
semi-private nook, an IRC channel he called “the cabin,” that
initially included only four individuals. Primarily conceived
of as a social space, one of the early members appended the
term “cr3w” onto the name, poking light fun at LulzSec and
the other self-proclaimed “crews” mushrooming at the time.
Operation BART, their very first op, accidentally transformed
CabinCr3w from a social channel into a prolific and functioning team. In the coming months they would grow to roughly
twenty participants. They would become known as specialists
in open-source data mining—muckraking through databases
provided by other hackers who would infiltrate servers in
search of information (though some hackers from CabinCr3w,
like Kahuna [John Anthony Borell III], and w0rmer [Higinio
O. Ochoa III] also engaged in digital trespass and were subsequently arrested).
But in mid-August, as OpBART was just beginning, the
team remained tiny. And because its labor force was small,
participants had to work around the clock for the first three
days. Utilizing Facebook, CabinCr3w connected with locals
to organize street protests and banded together with the
AntiSec 305
306 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
wider Anon community by reaching out to some established
organizers. A public #opbart IRC channel on AnonOps’
server became a rallying point. Everyone went to work drafting propaganda material to advertise the protest planned
for Monday, August 15. In a mode familiar from Operation
Avenge Assange, the organizers acted as choreographers—to
borrow Paolo Gerbaudo’s fitting term—who harnessed and
directed a fireball of fury.18
Alongside the protest and propaganda, some individuals engaged in some rather dicey, although admittedly lulzy,
behavior; it was these acts that attracted mainstream media
attention.
For instance, someone claiming the mantle of Anonymous
found a racy, semi-nude photo of BART’s Linton Johnson on
his personal website. This photo was then republished on the
“bartlulz” website—to considerable fanfare—along with this
brazen rationalization: “if you are going to be a dick to the
public, then I’m sure you don’t mind showing your dick to the
public … Umad Bro? #Bartlulz.”19
But more than anything else, it was a string of hacks that
attracted national media coverage, from CNN to Democracy
Now!
First, there was a website defacement on August 14. The
interlopers simply defaced myBART.org with an image of Guy
Fawkes. This was followed almost immediately by an intrusion that exposed the private data of 2,500 BART customers.
A day after the second protest at the Civic Center BART
station, organized by Anonymous and local activists, there
was another intrusion, on August 17, into a BART police
union website. This resulted in the publishing on Pastebin of
the home addresses, email addresses, and passwords of 102
BART police officers, among other employees.
The day I returned from Germany, Democracy Now! contacted me to inquire whether I could join them the next day
to speak about OpBART. I dreaded the prospect of being
asked about the blatant privacy violations committed by such 
hacks, and the gymnastics required to explain the use of such
tactics by a collective that ostensibly fought to protect privacy.
Thankfully, the next day I was joined on live TV by masked
Anon activist Commander X, and it was he who asked to offer
a rationale:
AMY GOODMAN: And your thoughts… on going after
the actual passengers themselves, people who might not
want that personal information out?
X: … How else do you get the world to respond and secure
your information? How else do you get these companies
and these big governments to keep your information, the
information you give them voluntarily, safe? I think we got
our message across, and I’ll bet you one thing: I’ll bet you
they fix that.20
Commander X, who spoke through a voice distorter, was not
responsible for the breach, but the alleged perpetrator and a
minority of other Anonymous activists shared their rationale.
At the time, I had no idea who was behind the hacks, nor how
other Anons viewed this breach. But soon after the interview,
I returned home to find out.
Although there was tremendous—almost unilateral—
support among Anons for protesting BART’s act of censorship,
the hacking and dumping of private customer data was
one of the most internally divisive acts I had yet witnessed.
Conversation on the channels, and even publicly over Twitter,
was brimming with criticism.
Consider, for instance, what happened when Lamaline_5mg
logged in to the public OpBART channel on August 17 and
claimed responsibility for the BART police union website
hack. She offered a link to the dox:
<Lamaline_5mg>: Hello y’all
<CrappyTIres>: Hi Lamaline_5mg
<Lamaline_5mg>: I have a small contribution.
AntiSec 307
308 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<Lamaline_5mg>: http://pastebin.com/XX7DJBqw
<Lamaline_5mg>: A leak from http://bartpoa.com/ [BART Police
Officers’ Association]
<Lamaline_5mg>: Enjoy, and share.
<CrappyTIres>: hmm
*CrappyTIres doesn’t like info leaks
<OpNoPro>: were those names ever shared before?
<Lamaline_5mg>: What?
<Lamaline_5mg>: I don’t know. I guess not.
<OpNoPro>: You dropped names and passwords
<OpNoPro>: We run a very clean operation here
<OpNoPro>: We are not interested in any thing like that
<OpNoPro>: Please refrain from dropping anybody’s private information
anywhere on anonymous’s behalf… not interested in breaching
somebody’s privacy… they have a right to it as much as you do
Not everyone agreed with OpNoPro. Others vocally supported the black hat ways of AnonOps:
<sharpie>: that’s his dump
<OpNoPro>: Do your jobs privately and nobody needs to know
<sharpie>: stfu
[…]
<Lamaline_5mg>: It’s not my fault for their crapy security.
<OpNoPro>: Take it easy sharp pen
<OpNoPro>: This is not a question for debate
<OpNoPro>: This is a question about keeping things separate
<sharpie>: people think this irc is a fucking church knitting group
<OpNoPro>: Please understand the situation
<sharpie>: yeah
<sharpie>: I do
<sharpie>: a lot more than you
<OpNoPro>: There are many portions to the IRC
*CrappyTIres looks for the knitting group
<OpNoPro>: Take it easy sharp pen
<OpNoPro>: Wake up
<OpNoPro>: Keep it separate
[…]
<sharpie>: take your moralfaggotry whitehat shit and shove it
<OpNoPro>: And if you ever see me in a knitting club that will be in
your eyes
<OpNoPro>: You have no idea what my morals are
Sharpie concluded by echoing one of the most common
rationales:
<sharpie>: how much publicity do you think “#opbart” would have
had without db dumps?
And then Lamaline_5mg said that she was not even
Anonymous—raising the ontological question of just what
makes one Anonymous anyway. She showed up on the
Anonymous IRC server, proffered some dox, and then proceeded to work with other Anons to craft a message to the
press; if that doesn’t make one an Anon, then what does?
Regardless, the distinction mattered little in relation to the
more general ethical questions surrounding hacking and
doxing. By now, thanks to AntiSec, these tactics were a
common fixture in the Anonymous landscape and would only
grow more controversial:
<Lamaline_5mg>: This is not anonymous.
<Lamaline_5mg>: Fuck you.
<w>: OpNoPro, like it or now, fractal chaos and tactics diversity is
what is fueling global revolution
<AlbaandOmegle>: Anon is a shitstarter
<AlbaandOmegle>: because it works
<OpNoPro>: take the dumps somewhere else
<w>: OpNoPro, you cannot prevent people from using an operation
name for doxing, ddosing and hacking
<w>: OpNoPro, even if that was the right choice, you simply can’t
<Lamaline_5mg>: I don’t use the operation name.
AntiSec 309
310 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Versions of this conversation would be repeated at least a
dozen times elsewhere over the next few days. My reading
was that most participants on AnonOps opposed the privacyviolating dumps, but mainly supportive of the other illegal
tactics, like the BART website defacement, the email and fax
bombing, and the DDoS (regardless of the fact that it failed—
BART had implemented good DDoS protection). A minority
supported the doxing simply because it served the greater
purpose of media attention, or was an example of the “fractal
chaos” that partly defined Anonymous.
The doxing also marked the first time that suspicions of a
“false flag operation” fully flared within Anonymous. A false
flag operation is a secret intervention in which a government
agent performs a controversial action on behalf of a political
group to seed mistrust and controversy or provide justification for the government’s own escalated response.
Two days later, Lamaline_5mg published a statement on
Pastebin that seemed to quell rumors of a false flag, though it
did little to extinguish the controversy:
I find it shameful that the media do not condemn taking
such drastic actions against a protest after the *killing* of
an innocent citizen. He was not proven guilty, or do they
actually judge people at their funeral? Implying this guy got
a proper funeral.
I also find it disturbingly sad that the San Francisco Bay
Area local media is being so supportive of the right to remain
anonymous of the BART police personnel, when they didn’t
give a shit about this man being killed.
Did they condemn the killing of this man?
All I did was give them (the cops) a taste of their own
medicine, ie ‘Lamaline’ which is an (anal) analgesic… (Look
it up)
It also means « The cunning », in french.21
In a subsequent interview with SF Weekly, Lamaline_5mg
claimed to be French, female, and a preteen (the last two being
unlikely). She said that the BART hack marked her very first
intrusion.
In the midst of all this, a pastebin.com message titled
“Anonymous is NOT unanimous” was picked up and read by
many participants:
Anonymous has a perception problem. Most people think
we’re a group of shadowy hackers. This is a fundamental
flaw. Anonymous is *groups* of shadowy hackers, and
herein lies the problem. Anonymous has done a lot of good
in just the past 9 months. It has helped with other groups
in providing aid to people on the ground in countries where
“democracy” is a bad word.
The mainstream media needs to understand that
Anonymous isn’t unanimous. I’ve yet to see wide scale
reporting make this distinction. A destructive minority is
getting a majority of the press, while those of us who toil
in the shadow doing good work for people at home and
abroad go unthanked.22
This statement captures Anonymous’s commitment to difference, plurality, and dissension—similar in form to the type
of adversarial politics advocated by radical theorist Chantal
Mouffe.23
Anons often disagree and engage in a strong war of words.
But very little energy is spent on systematically trying to
eliminate difference, or carving out some “middle ground”
resolution. Instead, differences are loudly voiced, listened
to, responded to, and reluctantly accepted; Anons widely
acknowledge that nothing drastic or meaningful can be done
to eliminate differences, and they carry on with their interventions or, if the disagreements are unbearable, break away to
form a new node.

Fuck AntiSec
The OpBART hacking controversy eventually receded. But
one controversy remained. As weeks turned into months, criticism of AntiSec’s defacements and hacks mounted, even as
the group’s support base grew. Some Anons saw AntiSec as
reckless, and many were suspicious of its motives. Rumors circulated that not only particular actions, but also the entirety
of AntiSec might be a false flag operation.
AntiSec, perhaps unsurprisingly, was simultaneously
respected, tolerated, and vilified. Many of AntiSec’s core
members had been essential to past iterations of the Anonymous/
AnonOps/LulzSec constellation. Their significance coincided
with the partial fading of WikiLeaks, which suffered from
internal frictions and legal troubles. AntiSec, it was hoped,
might expand to more directly challenge the powers wielded
by corporations and governments—not simply by producing
momentary spectacles, as is the case with DDoS attacks, but
also by whistleblowing—locating and releasing hard evidence
of malfeasance.
Despite constant hacks during the late summer and early
fall of 2011, very little of real substance was uncovered. (Had
Sabu not been an informant, it is likely that AntiSec would have
delivered more. The FBI notified some companies of breaches,
prompting the fast patching of holes, effectively closing doors
that AntiSec had only just opened.) One Anon who had been
centrally involved since the fall of 2010 quit in August 2011,
largely in disgust over AntiSec. While LulzSec dumped plenty
of data—such as usernames, email addresses, passwords,
emails, and other documents—much of it was seen to lack
political weight. And yet AntiSec managed to remain in the
spotlight. People began to resent this. There were many small
crews operating, most of them outside of the public eye. The
possibility was raised that AntiSec had become counterproductive, funneling attention, labor, and resources into worthless
activities. Another hacker who had been a core member of 
AnonOps IRC staff explained, “We got pissed off that AntiSec
was thrown on us. We had no warning. And they’d been
planning it for a while, coopting people from here.”
Worse, AntiSec began to raise hackles among some Anons
for a time-honoured Anonymous taboo: fame-seeking. One
Anon relayed this view on IRC in September 2011 in the course
of resigning from the group (pseudonym has been changed):
<ha>: wtf happened to #antisec
<ha>: let me tell you a story
<ha>: gather round kids
<ha>: Once upon a time there was a team of status fag hackers, most
of which where okay as people, we all have our flaws. They came to
be known as lulzsec
<ha>: These hackers decided it would be a good idea to use there
status fag powers to gather anons against the infosec industry.
<ha>: It was then someone decided to give monkies machine guns
and taught them the weakness of sql tables. These monkies decided
they wanted to look good for lulzsec and hacked every possible thing
they could, releasing all the information they plundered reguardless
to such things as consequence and public realtions.
<ha>: Private data leaked faster then WikiLeaks brand condom.
<ha>: They continued hacking away hoping to gain a pat on the back
from Sabu.
<ha>: Then the summer vacation ended.
<ha>: They found themselves unable to continue there hackery as
more pressing matters became apparent, such as who do i sit with
during lunch and whats a cooler elective to take, french or band.
<ha>: Thus ends the saga of #antisec
Earlier in the summer, the AnonOps network had grown so
critical of Barrett Brown that he decided to quit. He was
adamant that he was no longer involved in Anonymous,
focusing his energy on “Project PM,” a team wiki dedicated to
documenting the inner workings of private contractors doing
security work for the government. Later, Brown would assume
AntiSec 313
314 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
the moniker of Anonymous again—to take on the Mexican
drug cartels (a dumb and dangerous bluff). And he would
also receive information for ProjectPM from AntiSec, when
the group finally procured sensitive data from a security firm
called Stratfor. But that was months away. Brown remained,
at that time, a reminder that attention-seeking behavior was
frowned on.
AntiSec’s attention-seeking was more ambivalent and complicated than it had been with Brown. Unlike Brown, AntiSec
sought attention under a pseudo-anonymous mantle. And
some Anons stood by the crews’ actions, holding out hope
that their efforts would eventually produce some political,
classified, or secret information impossible to procure legally.
A cohort of black hat hackers (unaffiliated with) Anonymous
had had enough with AntiSec. A group of underground hackers
going by the name BR1CKSQU4D, which they seem to have
assumed only temporarily, released a document that included
some purported doxes of Anonymous and AntiSec members.
They opened by declaring:
! FUCK ANONYMOUS ! FUCK ANTISEC ! FUCK
ANONYMOUS ! FUCK ANTISEC24
Further along, they did not mince words:
And you wonder why the 90s groups you shout out (with
kids and families) won’t come out of retirement to help you?
You have accomplished nothing except inflaming ‘cyberwar’ rhetoric and fueling legislation that will end up with
hackers getting 50 years in prison.
The most retarded part is that you dont even realize you
are the cause of the very thing you hate;
Every time you DDoS a company Prolexic or DOSarrest
sign up a new customer.
Every time you SQL inject some irrelevant site a pentesting company gets a new contract.
Every time you declare cyberwar on the government
federal contractors get drowned in grant money.
Other hackers and netizens also began accusing Anonymous
of fortifying the cyberwar industrial complex. But it’s worth
noting that long before Anonymous came to prominence,
national governments around the world already aspired to
control the Internet and were already developing statutes that
eroded individual rights and privacies. Cybersecurity initiatives would be well funded with or without Anonymous. This
is not to say that all the group’s actions are justified. Still, in the
face of such a gargantuan surveillance state, what Anonymous
has enabled is a flexible platform for citizens to express their
dissent over long-entrenched trends.
But BR1CKSQU4D, wedded foremost to the black hat sensibility, ended the diatribe with a set of threats that harkened
right back to the original AntiSec mindset:
If you support antisec in any way you will be targeted.
Journalists, musicians, laywers, webhosts, VPN providers,
political commentators, profiteering businesses, you are all
valid targets.
You stepped into OUR world if you don’t want to play
the game get the fuck off the playing field.
[…]
We have <3 for the scene. Fuck the media.

chapter 10
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told
S
ummer in New York City is oppressive. Soaring temperatures combine with the harsh metropolitan reality to
create a dystopian urban hellion. The sun, reflected off
the glass skyscrapers, blinds you. Subterranean orifices lead
to the city’s viscera: the bowels of the stations and the intestines of the subway system, spitting people out. Sweat, sounds,
sights, as if these were not enough: you are also enclosed by
the mephitic, durian-like rot of the city—smells of deceased
rats and human waste, oven-baked by subway stations. So
when the cooler fall weather finally settles in, the city sighs
with collective relief. The hanging leaves of dazzling burnt
yellow, amber, and orange provide a complement to olfactory
respite. The swing to fall feels like a new lease on life. Finally,
you won’t be sweating all night long. Finally, the smell will be
washed away. Finally, respite.
On September 17, 2011, I awoke to a bundle of delicate
pink, purple, and red flowers protruding from a vase encased
in a Guy Fawkes mask. It was my birthday. The timing was
perfect: it was a day of protest in New York City. The financial collapse had seared its streak of corruption, oligarchy, and
the 1 percent into the minds of an angry generation. Instead
of being depressed, oppressed, and immobilized by the combination of the financial situation and the city’s heat, the day 
318 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
was crisp and it felt like there was a refreshing optimism that
people were ready to act upon. Nobody wanted to call it
hope—it was too early to declare such a thing—but the possibility was still on the table.
I grabbed the mask and made my way to Bowling Green,
near Wall Street. Approaching the small grassy park, I spied
out of the corner of my eye a number of young men with Guy
Fawkes masks slung over their shoulders. Upon seeing me, a
pair of them nodded. One gave a thumbs up and told me to
“Keep up the good work.” By early afternoon, protesters had
marched to what became the event’s target and nerve center,
Zuccotti Park (later renamed Liberty Square). Many came and
went as the day inched toward twilight and the first General
Assembly, but a steady stream of younger activists continually
trickled in with camping equipment on their backs and threw
their gear down.
Even if Occupy was defined by its rootedness in a place, it
was understood that social media could and should play a vital
role. Not the nor even a central agent of revolution, online
communication acted more like an adjuvant—it provided an
essential boost, facilitated coordination, and allowed those
unable to attend bodily to witness and become invested, and
entangled, in the events. And so on that first day of Occupy,
many of us were hooked to our phones even as we were
present at the square. Every half hour or so, I would fetch my
phone from my pocket and skim through my Twitter feed. In
the afternoon, two back-to-back messages from Sabu vaulted
off the screen. A month prior, on August 16, Sabu had vanished from Twitter after enigmatically tweeting, “The greatest
trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not
exist. And like that … he is gone.”1
 These new tweets marked
his reemergence with a roar:
“ATTN: I never left, I am NOT @AnonSabu or any of those
posers. I wasn’t owned, arrested, hacked or any of the other
rumors. Go get lives.”2
 He followed with another: “They tried
to snitch me out, troll me, dox every one around me, bait me 
into endless arguments but theres one thing they can’t do:
STOP ME!”3
In an early August chat, Sabu had warned me he was going
dark. “Sabu is a name that doesn’t need to exist eventually,”
he wrote.
<biella>: well ok
<biella>: then :-/
<biella>: not saying it does either nor that you should stick around
here, just sayin’ dont be a stranger Sabu
<Sabu>: well
<Sabu>: its not like im leaving to be a dick or run away
<Sabu>: its just that the community itself
<Sabu>: needs to look towards itself for motivation
<Sabu>: not me
<Sabu>: I feel too many people follow me
<Sabu>: and im not here to be a leader. yes im a natural born leader
<Sabu>: and yes if I wanted to I can lead this entire movement on my
own if I wanted to live like a dictactor
<Sabu>: but truth is
<Sabu>: I’m not the leader of anything involved with anonymous
<Sabu>: and by me leaving I prove this point
Following his exit from Twitter, and unbeknownst to myself,
Sabu remained active on various secret IRC channels. Also
unknown to me—and, in this case, even to those he worked
so closely with online—the day before our chat, on August
15, he had appeared in court. He had pled guilty to all twelve
charges leveled against him, including conspiracy to commit
bank fraud and aggravated identity theft and three counts of
conspiracy to commit computer hacking. Facing 124 years,
he agreed to work for the government in exchange for the
reduction of his maximum sentence to one hundred years. He
also assented to the “obligation to commit no further crimes
whatsoever.”4
Unlike his earlier disappearance in June due to his (also
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 319
320 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
secret) arrest, this time he had notified people that he was
going to take some time off. AntiSec members came and
went, a factor that further disabled suspicion of Sabu. He also
created a permanent connection to IRC using what is typically
called an “IRC bouncer,” “proxy,” or “screen session.” When
he wished, he could then reattach himself to the permanent
connection. This enabled him (and the FBI) to have access
to all conversations on the channels, and people could send
him messages, even when he was not online. Sabu’s method
of connecting aroused no mistrust because it is common for
hackers, many who are terminal junkies, to rely on such technical proxies.
When he initially left, I took his reasoning at face value. But
he was also going dark to deflect some strong accusations that
had recently come his way. Just before his public disappearance in August, a hacker named Mike “Virus” Nieves accused
Sabu of being a snitch. The logs of this exchange quickly surfaced on Pastebin. It started with Sabu obliquely suggesting
that someone in Virus’s crew was a rat. Virus bit back hard:
<Virus>: regarding topiary, you ratted him out
<Virus>: it’s so obvious sabu
<Sabu>: my nigga
<Virus>: but I keep my mouth shut
<Sabu>: you better watch your fucking mouth because I’m not a rat
<Virus>: I don’t get involved
<Sabu>: and I definitely didnt rat my own boy
<Virus>: I don’t care if “Anonymous” gets pwned
<Sabu>: I can tell you exactly how he got knocked
<Virus>: I never liked them, never will
<Sabu>: and if you actually knew anything you’d know how it went
down too
<Sabu>: for a hot minute there was some troll on twitter that’d hit up
atopiary’s twitter mentions with
<Virus>: Anonymous is nothing but a bunch of fat, pimply basement
dwelling losers who masturbate 3+ times a day
<Sabu>: “jake from shetland”
<Sabu>: he got it from an xbox forums
<Sabu>: topiary was an avid xbox gamer
<Sabu>: was known in the community talked a lot
<Sabu>: one of the forum users doxed him and kept throwing the
info out there
<Sabu>: enough that someone was smart enough to make the
connection
<Virus>: I’m a social engineer, a professional social engineer, actually
<Sabu>: I’m a social engineer too.5
Sabu tried to defuse the accusation first by showering Virus
with compliments, but when that failed, he switched strategies:
<Sabu>: you’d know that if I were raided
<Sabu>: I’d take myself down if anything
<Sabu>: I’m the martyr type
<Sabu>: I grew up in the streets
<Virus>: it’s a hunch, I’m always right
<Sabu>: this time you’re wrong
<Sabu>: I rather go down for my own shit than take down my own
niggas
At the time, the accusations seemed plausible, but certainly
not definitive. It was just as likely that the spat stemmed from
personal conflict—hacker drama—or that Mike Virus was
himself a snitch, trying to deflect attention. Virus even admitted that there was little evidence to back up his accusation; he
was relying on a hunch. As usual, Sabu was suave and fierce
in staving off the accusations.
Regardless, his lowered profile signaled that he was being
careful. During his hiatus, Anonymous did just fine. The
group had gone full throttle with OpBART, and soon after,
Occupy engaged its collective attention. Making ops run
smoothly requires an increased amount of communication
and shared time online, so it is not surprising that in these
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 321
322 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
intensive moments, the rumors exploded like a backdraft—or
that they burnt out almost as abruptly as they had flared up.
Sabu’s return on September 17, the day Occupy started, was
a shrewd move that helped nourish his mythos as a bona fide
revolutionary. Like a salmon who knows to return thousands
of miles upriver to where it was born, Sabu, it seemed, was
programmed to show up at an important political happening. His reappearance sent the following message: the allure of
a protest overrides everything else. The revolution was what
mattered. And accusations that seemed justified by his disappearance quickly looked more like unfounded drama.
Sabu seemed truly excited by Occupy, and as it gained
momentum he tweeted about it frequently. Other Anons
became similarly preoccupied. The turnout on the first day
was so meager that Nathan Schneider, who became one of the
most prominent chroniclers of the movement and later wrote
a book about it, recalled: “I didn’t think it would last. I didn’t
think it would change anything.”6
 But thanks to the persistence of the occupiers, thanks to the social media messages,
and thanks to the police (who sparked mass-media attention
and public outrage by cracking down against peaceful protesters and marches), in less than two weeks Occupy transformed
from smoking embers into a bonfire.
“My days are numbered”
The first week of Occupy, I returned to the camp a few
times—and would later join some of the large New York City
marches—but as a full-time professor with two classes, a book
to finish, and a string of appointments in preparation for an
approaching move to a foreign country, it was tough to be
there as much as I would have liked. Sometimes other factors
kept me away as well. On Tuesday, September 20, my day
seemed to be miraculously free, but gazing out my window
into the drizzly morning, I was prompted to contemplate all 
the other valid uses of my time. And call it fate, but had it not
been for this lazy reluctance, I might never have met Sabu in
the flesh. Of course, reflecting now on the events that transpired, I can only think that it might have been better if I had
braved the rain.
Late in the afternoon that day, the rain now gone, I headed
to NYSEC, the informal meet-up of security professionals. I
ambled toward Swift, a Greenwich Village bar. From a distance, I spotted weev, the famous troll who had headed up
Goatse Security and now lived in the Tri-State Area awaiting
trial. A cigarette dangled from his mouth and he was talking
to two people I did not know.
weev was tipsy and content. You could tell that he was
gearing up for a good rant. He sported a pin from Trinity
Church, where he regularly attended service—and the sermon
he was preparing was on the subject of Occupy. It was unclear
whether he supported Occupy or merely saw it as an opportunity to troll. He gave one memorable speech, managing to
indict the evil financiers, call out police brutality with a nod
to Oscar Grant, and speak to state threats against artisanal
cheese makers, all in four minutes. But at other times, weev
also held up a sign “ZIONIST PIGS ROB US ALL.”7
 weev
greeted me. Upon hearing my name, one of the other hackers
raised his eyebrows. “So you are Gabriella who studies
Anonymous?” he asked. I replied in the affirmative. weev
updated us about Occupy and we headed inside. We fetched
some drinks and settled into the back room with the twenty
or so hackers already there. I figured that the other hacker
(let’s call him Freddy) likely followed Anonymous from a distance, like many security researchers. But as it turned out, he
knew a lot more than I could have imagined. As the evening
wore on, Freddy and I found ourselves in a dark corner of the
bar. “Are you an FBI agent?” he asked—a question that no
longer rattled me the way it might have only a few months
previous. I replied, in a somewhat annoyed tone, “No. In
fact, I just accepted a position in Canada. Why would the FBI
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 323
324 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
ship me off to a country they largely ignore if I were working
for them?”
He clearly knew a great deal about Anonymous, including
the secret back-channel IRC groups like #internetfeds. I was
informed, also, that he was arranging a meeting between Sabu
and Parmy Olson, who was in the midst of writing a book on
Anonymous. (Olson says this didn’t happen, though she did
acknowledge having contact with Freddy.) As our conversation unfolded, it became increasingly clear: he was deep inside
Anonymous, and seemed to have known Sabu for quite some
time.
Freddy also intimated that Sabu was in New York City.
This aligned with hints I had gotten directly from him in our
chats. But there were a lot of swirling rumors about Sabu,
many maintaining, contrarily, that he lived in Brazil. It seemed
equally credible; he worked closely with Brazilian hackers and
often spouted off in Portuguese on Twitter.
The information flowed both ways: I spoke about a number
of AntiSec and AnonOps IRC backchannels and shared details
pertaining to many “black ops.” His interest was piqued. And
then I mentioned that I was raised in Puerto Rico. Upon hearing
this, he offered point blank: “Do you want to meet Sabu?”
He could arrange it. I was totally taken aback. I told him,
“Meeting him intrigues me, but, to be frank, I am skeptical.”
The conversation excited me, less due to the prospect of
meeting Sabu—I truly was skeptical—and more for the taste
of what many hackers experience all the time: the use of secrets
as an valuable object of exchange. Those who write about
secrecy commonly recount how an information seeker can, by
providing a secret of his or her own, induce further disclosure
from his or her interlocutor. Graham Jones, an anthropologist
of magicians, describes sharing secrets as “a token of recognition, a gesture of inclusion, a microritual of initiation, and a
move in a system of exchange.”8
 Sharing secrets can be about
revenge or about forging trust. It can be a simple display of
status, or a measured revelation in the hopes of prompting a 
response. But whatever the reasons and whatever the mechanisms, secrets shared often do beget more secrets.
Back in the bar, my mind raced. Is this guy just a regular
guy, or is he working on behalf of the government? We did
meet by chance … didn’t we? Eventually, I decided to leave
the bar. At home, exhausted, I transcribed every detail I could
remember before passing out fully clothed.
Early the next morning, I made my way to a neighborhood
cafe as usual. A couple of hours later, sipping at my second or
third coffee, I was lost in work. My IRC client, as was usually
the case, was running but ignored. My name flashed on the
screen, signaling a private message. Deep in work mode, and
allowing no interruptions, I attended to the query after forty
minutes had passed. I toggled to the window:
<Sabu>: estas?
<Sabu>: yo
<Sabu>: you there?
<biella>: hi
<biella>: yes
<biella>: am here
[…]
<Sabu>: checkea tu fucking voicemail loca
[…]
<biella>: lol i am wondering here, should i be doing this? :-)
<biella>: giving out my cell to one of the most notorious hackers of
all time ?
<biella>: let me listen to the vm first but you know someone you
know has it
<biella>: if i went to my office now would you be able to talk? or
should i just listen to my VM?
<biella>: i am across the street at a coffee shop
<Sabu>: cono biella just go listen and delete
Back at my office, there was a message and a number. I called
and our first phone conversation lasted for an hour. Haughtily
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 325
326 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
declaring himself “the most trusted” hacker, he asked, “What
the fuck is up with the snitches?” He then launched into a
three-part typology: First, there are the “infiltrators.” Second,
there are “those that want fame.” And third, there are “those
that are pinned to the wall and don’t want to go to jail.”
Almost everything he said made me blind to Sabu himself. But
just in case I had my doubts, he hammered away with statements like: “Even if the FBI was outside my door and heard
what I said, there is no way they could pin the technical act on
me … That is why I am not locked up.” At the time, this struck
me as a perfectly plausible explanation.
The rest of the conversation largely centered on politics,
with him ranting and boasting, and me listening. He railed
against the NYPD, claiming they were far more corrupt than
the FBI—willing to implant false information and break their
own rules. He railed against Sony and AT&T, insisting that
they were the criminals for the shitty state of their security.
The conversation turned to WikiLeaks. He proclaimed it a
“tragedy” that Assange had squandered an amazing opportunity, but ultimately expressed his love for Manning.
Finally, I had to interrupt and ask, “Why reach out?”
His reply was immediate. “My days are numbered,” he reasoned. “This story needs to get out and the media will not
do the job.” The conversation wound down, leaving me to
ponder just what he meant by this.
It wasn’t long before we talked again. This time he was on
the street, evident from the noise of honking cars and the side
conversations between him and his homies. He told me, “Cops
are chasing a black kid over a bag of weed.” This second conversation centered around his defense of Anonymous’s style
of hacking. “We are no skids,” he insisted, referring to the
eternally derided “script kiddies.” He described LulzSec as a
“proof of concept” which had done more than “any other
hacker group in fifteen years.” He called AntiSec his brainchild.
I was writing at breakneck speed but, unaccustomed to
taking notes longhand, my cramping wrist proved unsuited to 
the task. Ultimately, none of it was too surprising. Until, that is,
the end of the conversation. “I hope I don’t sound like a dick,”
he started. “But I refuse to let my politics die. This is how I feel.
I will continue to push for the idea of decentralized organizing.” He paused, and then continued, “With decentralization,
it is harder to infiltrate.” But, “There are snitches.” He ended
gruffly. He wanted “war. I want total revenge for Recursion. He
is just a college student.” Just days before, twenty-three-year-old
Cody Kretsinger from Phoenix, Arizona, had been arrested by
the FBI in connection with hacking Sony Pictures with LulzSec.
During these initial phone conversations, Sabu had intimated that he wanted to meet. I was growing interested in the
prospect—but I was determined not to hold my breath. There
was much to do in the meantime, as Anonymous’s involvement in Occupy escalated. As camps sprang up across North
America and Europe, a handful of core Anonymous veterans
traded days and nights online for days and nights in the field.
A few even found contingents of occupiers who identified as
Anons but had never logged into an IRC channel.
On occasion, the two distinct though complementary movements directly crossed streams in a more dramatic fashion. On
Sunday, September 25, protesters gathered at Union Square
and marched south toward the camp, until police enclosed
them behind a length of orange plastic netting. Occupiers
chanted, “Shame! Shame! Who are you protecting?! YOU are
the 99 percent! You’re fighting your own people!” A highranking police officer, Anthony Bologna, whipped out his can
of pepper spray without provocation and directed the chemical stream at three young women. As the liquid engulfed their
faces and stung their eyes, they crumpled to the ground, pleading, “No! Why are you doing that?!”9
 Bologna answered by
sauntering away.
Onlookers filmed the entire incident and the video went
viral. Anonymous retaliated by swiftly doxing the officer—
uploading his name and address to Pastebin. It opened with
this message:
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 327
328 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
As we watched your officers kettle innocent women, we
observed you barbarically pepper spray wildly into the
group of kettled women. We were shocked and disgusted by
your behavior. You know who the innocent women were,
now they will have the chance to know who you are. Before
you commit atrocities against innocent people, think twice.
WE ARE WATCHING!!! Expect Us!10
Bologna’s information was uploaded by a young female
college student who “earned her badge” in the CabinCr3w for
the effort. During an online interview I conducted with her,
she explained the mechanics of her expose: “a lot of rewatching [the video], zooming, trying to get facial features, badge
number, and a partial name. It turns out that when I resorted to
just a simple google, I found out that he had previously been a
problem with abuse, and had a case against him.” (There was
a pending lawsuit against him brought by a protester at the
2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.)
Since she did not strike me as someone who doxed for doxing’s sake, I asked where she drew the line between acceptable
exposure and privacy violation: “[the police] work for the
public, therefore your life … is public just as a news organisation would hound you.” She continued, “morally: I think
there is a limit and boundary by which how deep the dox
go,” claiming she only disclosed information that identified
Bologna himself. Other Anons, however, decided to go deeper,
doxing members of his family.
The NYPD defended Bologna’s actions at first, but soon
retracted. An internal police review determined that the officer
had indeed violated protocol. As punishment, he lost ten days
of vacation and was reassigned to Staten Island (implicitly
divulging the NYPD’s opinion of the city’s smallest borough).11
There was, at least, a silver lining. The incident helped catapult Occupy onto the national stage. The Guardian and other
major news outlets reported on the event, quoting directly
from Anonymous’s Pastebin message and cementing a nascent 
association between Anonymous and Occupy.12 From that day
on—and especially following the mass arresting of over seven
hundred people during a peaceful march across the Brooklyn
Bridge—Occupy became a fixture in activist circles and the
mainstream media alike.
Meeting Sabu
Thanks to a detailed FAQ published by the New York City
Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, we know roughly how many sidewalk payphones dot the
five boroughs: “As of January 2, 2014 there are 9,903 active
public pay telephones on or over the City’s sidewalks.”13 I,
personally, had never even noticed them, until Sabu asked me
to use one. He did not want to arrange a meeting online. It felt
safer and prudent to use a payphone; key loggers are always a
possibility with computers.
Our first rendezvous was scheduled for soon after Bologna’s
doxing, on October 3 at the Chipotle on St. Mark’s Place in
the East Village. He assured me that “you will recognize me.”
The one picture purporting to be Sabu floating around the
web was of a wiry, yet muscular, Latino man. I arrived early.
The minutes moved slowly, until suddenly, I was aware of a
tall commanding figure sauntering toward me. Carrying his
large body with aplomb, he seemed to be in his element. It was
Sabu. He grabbed my hand and I was afraid it would shatter
in his grip. I gathered my things and we went to order food.
In the midst of our small talk, Sabu paused, casually nodded
to the food prep worker (a tough-looking Latina), and asked,
“What’s up?”
She replied, “I have not seen you here in a while.” As would
become increasingly clear, whether in Chipotle, a local diner,
or Tompkins Square Park, many locals knew Sabu and treated
him with deference—out of respect or fear, I can’t say which,
but he was clearly a known quantity in the neighborhood.
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 329
330 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Before long, he steered the conversation toward his past. “I
came from a drug family,” he divulged almost immediately,
and then continued nonchalantly: “By the time I was thirteen
or fourteen, I carried four to five thousand dollars in cash in
my wallet.” He also explained that he was the “father figure”
to his adopted cousins—both younger than seven at the time—
though he left the reason for taking on such massive parental
responsibilities unstated until later. (When Sabu was thirteen,
his aunt and father were sent to jail for dealing heroin. He
was raised by his grandmother until she passed away on June
7, 2010, exactly one year before he was apprehended by the
FBI. Upon her passing, he assumed parental responsibility for
his cousins.)
Sabu said that he worked hard to overcome a “ghetto mentality,” an immobilizing mixture of self-hatred and anger.
Later, he briefly recounted a few episodes that substantiated
his everyday experience with harsh racism. Sabu attended
Washington Irving High School, near East Sixteenth Street,
alongside many poor students. One day, entering the school,
he walked through a metal detector and, carrying a screwdriver, was stopped by a guard. He defended himself: “I am
the geek that fixes your system when you forget not to execute
‘weird’ .exe’s.” The guard bought none of it and a tiff between
the two ensued. Sabu, who felt disrespected, complained to
the administration, but found only deaf ears. So he made
some noise by penning a strident, and self-described “controversial,” missive and circulating it to teachers. The principal
deemed it “threatening” and he was temporarily suspended.
Sabu, reflecting later upon the incident in a Pastebin document, concluded: “Very well then, it is such a shame that one
… such as myself would have to be deprived of my education
because of my writing.”14
It made immediate sense, then, why Sabu found hacking—
with its elevation of ideas and arguments—to be an appealing
oasis. This is not to say that the zone of hacking is free of
prejudice. Far from it. The white male-dominant scene, with 
some hackers especially prone to acting out elitist cowboy
bravado, is alienating and repellent to many.15 The barriers
are especially pronounced in underground quarters that are
composed nearly exclusively of male (and a few transgender)
participants. Nevertheless, since ideas are (in theory) exalted
over social pedigree, it has functioned as a safe space, at least
online, for a class of technical weirdos.16 The social boundaries erected by hackers also exhibit contradictions: while the
gender gap is vast, some identities—such as transgender, queer,
or disabled—are more common and accepted. (It took some
time, but I eventually figured out that the chatroom #lounge
on AnonOps doubled at times as a gay pickup spot.) Sabu’s
explanation that he “rarely hangs out with hackers in person”
hints at the sort of partial freedoms provided by anonymity
and technical skills online.
After we said our goodbyes, I could not help but think of
Sabu as a cooler and savvier version of Oscar Wao, the lead
character in Junot Díaz’s electrifying novel on the travails of
being a corpulent, ostracized, “hardcore sci-fi and fantasy”–
loving nerd of Dominican descent. The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao tells the story of Oscar as he shuttles
between New Jersey and the Dominican Republic, bumbling
through life while trying to fulfill a cherished rite of passage:
getting laid.
Sabu, like Oscar, is a consummate cultural boundary-crosser,
flitting easily between vastly distinct cultural spheres. Unlike
Oscar, Sabu was no dud, and his machismo was overpowering.
He was notorious for hitting on the ladies in #AnonOps and
told journalist Quinn Norton in a chat, “I like you quinn, next
time you’re in new york, you can watch me hack, naked.”17
With me, he was more restrained, alternating between calling
me “mi amor” (“my love”) and “cupcake.”
After our first meeting, now mentally equipped with a picture
of Sabu, I resumed my chats with him. The Guardian newspaper had asked Sabu to write an op-ed about Occupy. He asked
me to give some editorial feedback. Meanwhile, I attempted
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 331
332 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
to convince him to be filmed for Brian Knappenberger’s documentary We Are Legion:
<Sabu>: also
<Sabu>: if I do this thing with your boy knapp
<Sabu>: you gotta make sure that nigga doesnt leak my identity
More than any other journalist covering Anonymous, Brian
Knappenberger had sought out a wide cross section of individuals, pouring his funds and time into a project he was wildly
passionate about. I wanted to help him. That Sabu was considering doing it was great news, but I had to reassure him about
my ability to be discreet and to impress upon Knappenberger
the necessity of further discretion. My protocol was generally one of “silos of interaction.” When I chatted on public
channels, an observer could get a sense of who I spoke with,
but my private chats were largely confidential, following a
protocol commonly adopted in Anonymous. Eventually, a
small group of the journalist/researcher confederacy—namely
Knappenberger and Olson—knew I had met Sabu, but otherwise I kept it to myself.
Our seemingly trivial conversations would sometimes
become much more interesting in retrospect. For example, the
following conversation, which happened the day after we first
met, seemed relatively mundane at the time:
<Sabu>: and ioerror is good people [ioerror = Tor developer Jacob
Appelbaum]
<Sabu>: I’m trying to reach out to him
<Sabu>: I know hes been supportive of me in the last year
<Sabu>: I want to support him back
<biella>: yea he has
<Sabu>: during this time
<biella>: i know him well
<Sabu>: they’re trying to rail him
<biella>: for over 9 years now
<Sabu>: tell him I send my regards then
<biella>: i will for sure
<Sabu>: if theres anything we can do for him, to pass it through you
At the time, I interpreted this as a reasonable gesture of solidarity. Now, these chats—and his motivations for reaching out
to me in the first place—look different. The “we” he referred
to was not Sabu and Anonymous. It was Sabu and the FBI—
privileged with direct access to all his conversations, including
the one above. It would not be the last time he tried to “to
reach out to” Applebaum through me.
The Propensity to Sympathize with Others
In late October, as winds shook off the remaining leaves still
clinging to branches, Occupy was blossoming. Organizers
were branching out; alliances with unions and other civil
society groups yielded new rivers of people flowing into
Liberty Square on October 15, a planned “day of action.” As
I marched for hours alongside throngs of strangers, everyone
appeared energized and amazed by the vibrant turn Occupy
had taken in the short course of a single month. “The Occupy
assemblies were opening tremendous space in American political discourse,” reflected Nathan Schneider, who also noted that
“by mid-October, Occupy Wall Street had an approval rating
of more than 50 percent—higher than President Obama or
Congress.”18
Naysayers and pundits would accuse Occupy of being led by
lifestyle activists, for fizzling out after being unable to drum up
broad-based support—a misguided account made clear by the
repressive crackdown that would come, just one month later,
to stamp out many of the US camps. Documents procured by
the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund through a Freedom of
Information Act request reveal that most every law enforcement entity—Department of Homeland Security, the FBI,
The Desire of a Secret Is to Be Told 333
334 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
local police, Fusion Centers, the Joint Terrorism Task Force,
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and even, oddly, the
Federal Reserve—took a keen interest in Occupy.19 Since the
documents are so heavily redacted, it is hard to gauge the specific role played by each organization, but it is clear that, at
minimum, they “Cast [a] Wide Net in Monitoring Occupy
Protests,” as the New York Times titled its piece covering
the documents.20 One reason why Anonymous had already
thrived for five years was that despite the arrests of members
of the collective, its decentralized and online character had
made preemption extremely difficult. This would not prove to
be the case with Occupy.
I continued to meet Sabu. On some occasions, his two
younger brothers accompanied him. The older one was Sabu’s
sidekick. He admired him and, while not as technically proficient as Sabu, he loved to talk about computers. The younger
one, who sported sleek, straight, black-as-night hair and a lot of
muscles, was, like many teenagers, absorbed in thought, totally
uninterested in the geek talk that consumed the rest of us.
One meeting stands out. On an unusually warm November
evening, we hung out in Tompkins Square Park with his brothers again. Then Sabu and I went to the Odessa, a classic New
York City diner with a mind-boggling array of dining options.
By now, one thing had become clear: Sabu was a talker.
Entering the diner, Sabu greeted with a handshake a man
whom I presumed to be the owner or the manager. Easing into
a booth, we became one with the ageless Naugahyde seats,
their well-worn springs clenching us desperately. That day he
broached a dizzying number of topics in the course of our conversation: gentrification, the hacker Phiber Optik, Middle East
politics, Occupy, his dog (whose name was China, and who
had an awful skin condition), the sociology of hacker crews,
the Anonymous haters, and dozens of other topics that his
mind alighted upon. Among the deluge of details, a few stood
out. It was the first time he mentioned a mysterious hacker
he worked closely with, whom he called “burn.” I now know 
him as Jeremy Hammond. Sabu boasted that he liked to own
security companies while “burn liked to hit the police.” And
in this conversation, one thing became patently evident: more
than anything else, Sabu seemed to genuinely care what others
thought of not only himself, but the whole of Anonymous. His
contempt for those critical of Anonymous—both journalists
and random people on Twitter—was noticeable; he jeered at
those who he felt had not treated him, or Anonymous, with
respect. Soon after, winding down, he sighed in a weary voice.
“I sometimes just want to walk away and quit.” He did seem
tired, and he had developed a chronic cough since our previous meeting. I knew he had also talked extensively with Olson
over Skype, and it struck me suddenly that he had a burning
desire for his life story to be put out into the world.
When someone is wearing a mask, there is at least a symbolic reminder that insincerity, duplicity, and play might be
at work. Sitting across from Sabu, seeing his face, hearing his
voice, and looking into his eyes, I suspended my mistrust, even
though I knew that with or without a mask, I really had no
access to his true motivations. We can never really access the
inner thoughts of other humans; we can only attempt to gauge
sincerity or authenticity. Then there’s what Hume identified
as one of the most enduring qualities of human nature: “No
quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and
in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others.”21
It’s hard to constantly question people’s motives. It is precisely the human proclivity to want to sympathize that enables
the FBI to perform exploits through its informants. We left
The Odessa and, as usual, Sabu lit up a sweet-smelling cigarette. He took a deep puff from the white filter. And then,
suddenly, he confessed: “I was indeed a criminal. I used to sell
heroin.” Then he walked away.

The Sabutage
Although AntiSec had been on a hacking spree, compromising high-profile targets like the FBI, the group
was not getting much attention—and the attention it
did get was not exactly positive. Certain data dumps, such
as those regarding police units (including the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, Boston Police Patrolmen’s
Association, and the Sheriff’s Office of Baldwin County,
Alabama) struck some Anons as random and incoherent—
many people, even within Anonymous, didn’t quite see the
point. A supporter of information leaks, Anonymous9 felt
that AntiSec’s ops weren’t cutting the mustard. “Just because
a lunch menu at Fort Meade might be classified,” he told me,
“doesn’t mean it is interesting much less worth leaking.” Then,
just in time for “LulzXmas,” a mysterious hacker named
hyrriiya delivered a gift. On December 13, 2011, a few AntiSec
members pulled the journalist Quinn Norton and myself aside
into a channel to ask a question:
<Antisec>: will journos cover stuff that’s probably
<Antisec>: deeply illegal
<Antisec>: lol
<quinn>: yes, but framing is important
<Antisec2>: Not illegal like ddos or leaking some cops emails. ;)
338 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
<biella>: deeply as opposed to surface illegal
<Anon>: we have a table of illegal categories
[…]
***Anon checks the cheatsheet
<biella>: Anon, do you??
<biella>: lolll
***Anon thinks ‘fuck we r screwed’
<quinn>: is this like a mandatory minimums kind of chart?
<quinn>: heheh
<Anon>: hahaa
<biella>: OFF THE CHARTS illegal
Soon after this chat, an AntiSec member casually informed me
that they possessed credit card data and intended to use it for
charitable donations. While he kept the source of the database
a secret, it remained one of the few instances where sensitive
information was sprung upon me. I publicly maintained my
caveat: I could not guarantee the confidentiality of any information given to me. And, as if that wasn’t enough to freak me
out, Jeremy Hammond (using the name “sup_g”) queried me
on December 15:
<sup_g>: Not sure if you are down, able, or safe to examine some
data pre-release, but there’s some mail spools available.
<biella>: not right now, sorry :-(though i look forward to hearing
about it
By now, my interactions with Hammond were limited and contained. Most of our conversations were rolled into group chats
in the private CabinCr3w channel (where he was “sup_g”) and
in Barrett Brown’s Project PM (where he was “o”). With time,
I connected these two nicknames and remained undecided
about him. He kept a pretty low profile, except when political
discussions would draw him out and suddenly he would flood
the chat with his views, in a rather heated fashion. Hammond
was hands down the most insurgent of the bunch. Though his 
dedication was evident, I could not help but at times imagine
him to be an agent provocateur.
When he offered me a pre-release of the email spool, my
alarms sounded. Is this entrapment? Unlike Brown, whose
begging for these very emails fell on deaf AntiSec ears (he was
never given them), I desperately tried to avoid receiving this
kind of information. And, anyway, why—after all my caveats
and all their attempts to remain mum—were they suddenly
offering to toss me all this information? It seemed fishy, and it
stressed me out.
Thankfully a deeper reservoir of secrets was actually being
kept from me. Most significant was that the AntiSec crew,
at the onset of December, had become deeply suspicious of
Sabu. As one member told me later, various hackers continued
appearing, at random, and insisting, mantra-like, that “Sabu
is an informant.” Hammond too had grown tired of Sabu’s
reluctance to get his hands dirty, an indicator that something
was amiss. At the time, they kept their concerns to themselves.
On Christmas Eve, AntiSec decided to publicly release the
details of its most memorable—and unforgiving—hack. In a
politically motivated act of corporate sabotage, AntiSec infiltrated the internal network of the global intelligence firm
Strategic Forecasting, Inc., better known as Stratfor. AntiSec
collected over 50,000 credit card numbers, downloaded almost
eight years’ worth of company emails—five million in total—
and procured countless other records. As a finale, they gutted
Stratfor’s servers of their data, removing everything they could
find (including backups). In what AntiSec described as “an
act of loving egalitarian criminality,”1
 they attempted to use
30,000 of the credit cards to donate an estimated $700,000
to “the Bradley Manning Support Organization, the EFF, the
ACLU, CARE, American Red Cross, Amnesty International,
Greenpeace, some commies, some prisoners, various occupations, and many more unnamed homies.”2
 (Only 9,561 of
the cards were still valid.) Let’s now take a closer look at the
events leading up to AntiSec’s mothership hack.
The Sabutage 339

Total Mayhem
On December 4, hyrriiya, a member of a small hacker crew
called RevoluSec (which worked on infiltrating Syrian government computers, among other projects) reached out to Sabu:
<hyrriiya>: wake up
<hyrriiya>: got funny shit u will love
<Sabu>: im here brother
<Sabu>: whats up
<hyrriiya>: :=
<hyrriiya>: so i hax this intelligence company
<hyrriiya>: by accident
This immediately piqued Sabu’s interest:
<Sabu>: we would love to penetrate their users/network for #antisec
definitely get me details so I can begin working :)
<hyrriiya>: :p
<hyrriiya>: the network is on hold right now
<hyrriiya>: soon as i extract what i need
<hyrriiya>: i give it to you
<hyrriiya>: but i’d advise to pwn them and sniff for a few months
<hyrriiya>: my own countries secret services use their services :p
<hyrriiya>: cnn uses them
<hyrriiya>: etc
<hyrriiya>: the economist lol
The next day, hyrriiya provided, as Jeremy Hammond later
related to me, “the entire [AntiSec] channel a link to Stratfor
order databases, including addresses, and credit cards [and]
random credit card numbers swiped from the Stratfor
database.” Sabu created another channel called “#!sec”
and hyrriiya delivered the information about the exploit.
Hammond described the hack to me in great technical detail
(though it’s not essential to understanding the story): 
No password, oops! which lets you download the entire db
dump, from mysql db access, here I am able to insert users
into str’s [Stratfor’s] drupal system, creating an administrator account, then enabling PHP code on drupal articles, and
inserting a PHP backdoor into a drupal article allowing
remote code execution on str’s webserver (they kept different
boxes for various services), then rooted the webserver, then
was able to log onto their mailserver using an “autobot”
user that had access to several of their other internal servers
for backup purposes, rooted that too.
As if having no password protection was not negligent enough,
Stratfor’s credit card information was saved in clear text, instead
of behind a digital fortress of encryption, as is standard industry practice. Apparently, while Stratfor sold security briefings to
its clients, it did not seem to follow any of its own advice.
AntiSec intended to liberate eight years of emails from
Stratfor’s servers—more than two hundred gigabytes. Finding
a good place to put it, with enough space and bandwidth, was a
bit of an issue. Hammond opted to hack some other machines
to provide this service. A few other AntiSec members began
researching methods toward deeper infiltration into Stratfor’s
systems, while some who had only wanted to ignite the fire
soon departed.
hyrriiya’s role was as a messenger alone, and he eventually
bailed on the rest of the operation:
<hyrriiya>: also another thing
<hyrriiya>: when i get u the details
<hyrriiya>: please forget that it came from me :)
<hyrriiya>: and that revolusec had anything to do with it :p
<hyrriiya>: as this company is full of crazy feds :p
<hyrriiya>: and we don’t need the credit.)
<hyrriiya>: :)
<Sabu>: yup
<Sabu>: #antisec has been to war with feds/nato since june
The Sabutage 341

On Christmas Eve, I received a query from a mysterious user
named “ghost__”—another incarnation of Hammond himself,
as I later learned. He gave me the most explosive news I would
receive in all my time studying Anonymous:
<ghost__>: hello
<ghost__>: shit’s getting owned on anonops
<biella>: hello
<ghost__>: about to rm -rf a major target
I was not sure what he meant by the first statement, but
the second was clear. I may be no technology wizard, but I
knew what “rm -rf/” was, having been a Linux user for over
fourteen years. Once you have root access, this command
can delete everything on the system (technically speaking,
Hammond conveyed his actions in shorthand because newer
UNIX systems have protections built-in, such as requiring the
“--no-preserve-root” flag to be passed first, making it harder
to delete everything by accidentally typing six characters). I
tried to play it cool. I still wasn’t sure what he was talking
about. He gave a few more details:
<ghost__>: it is a major intelligence corporation
<ghost__>: ~30 min
<biella>: hmm ok
<ghost__>: meanwhile, credit cards being used on anonops
Soon, my confusion was cleared up by tweets like the following from Sabu: “http://www.stratfor.com - #ANTISEC
DISMANTLES A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR INTELLIGENCE CORPORATION - watch the video and read the
essay. #antisec.”3 I thought to myself, holy sweet birth of the
baby Jesus, this is really happening!
A handful of people were livid or confused, but most seemed
to be riding the wave with trolling/humorous responses on
the public channels: “VOTING STILL GOING ON FOR 
LULZXMAS DONATION PICK; options are (in order of
leading to losing); CANCER, TOR, AIDS, WIKILEAKS,
SHELTERS, REDCROSS, ANONOPS.”
AntiSec replaced Stratfor’s webpage with The Coming
Insurrection, a revolutionary tract written by the radical,
anonymous Invisible Committee. Its ostensibly French
authors, seeking to hasten the demise of capitalism, call for
new modes of collective association and the rapid deployment of an “effective guerrilla war that restores us to our
ungovernability, our primordial unruliness.”4
 From Christmas
Day through to New Years, the pace of hacking redoubled.
Pursuant of a generalized sort of mayhem, AntiSec thought it
necessary to thrash more than just a single organization; while
news coverage focused almost exclusively on Stratfor, AntiSec
had in fact carried out a “coast-to-coast hacking” bonanza,
and announced as much proudly in their zine:
On New Years Eve, while revolutionary comrades brought
the noise to the front of jails across the world in support
of the incarcerated, we were opening fire on the websites
and emails of the 1%, publishing stolen information from
police departments in both California and New York. From
coast to coast we lulzed as we hit the top police chiefs: skimming their private email and Facebook accounts, blissfully
abusing their internal law enforcement portals, and making
off quick with their private documents which we then published on tor hidden services and BitTorrent. Finally, we
defaced their websites and rm’d their servers, live on IRC
and Twitter for the whole world to see.5
AntiSec’s three additional targets were cslea.com (the
California Statewide Law Enforcement Association—selftouted, it is worth noting, as “America’s most fascinating
law enforcement association”); nychiefs.org (New York State
Association of Chiefs of Police); and specialforces.com (a
marketplace for, as the name may suggest, gear oriented toward
The Sabutage 343
344 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
special forces operations). Each site added to the growing
AntiSec collection of mail spools, usernames, passwords, emails,
phone numbers, and “Law Enforcement Sensitive” documents.
The whole while Sabu remained unflappably brazen and
ferocious. In reply to an ex-supporter who blamed AntiSec
for being irresponsible, he bit back: “FUCK the intelligence
community. the security industry. and everyone in between.
We support the people.”6
 He painted Stratfor as the criminals: “@STRATFOR has potentially broken the law by storing
customer data, unencrypted, on an [sic] publicly accessible
insecure server. Question them.”7
 The internal accusations and
suspicions of Sabu were mitigated by moments like these. But
accusations persisted. A few Pastebin announcements surfaced
on the subject. One was entitled “Press Release: Stratfor Hack
NOT Anonymous” and chided Sabu: “Sabu and his crew are
nothing more than opportunistic attention whores who are
possibly agent provocateurs.”8
Just a few weeks prior to LulzXmas, Sabu had finally agreed
to meet with Brian Knappenberger to be filmed for his documentary—but only if certain conditions were met. Sabu was
to be concealed and his voice distorted, and Knappenberger
was to leave no digital trace of his travels or whereabouts.
He would have to get to New York City by paying for his
airline ticket and hotel in cash—making sure to choose
a hotel or place to sleep where ID was not required. I was
away for the holidays and returned to New York City (and
a relentless downpour) on December 26 expressly to assist
Knappenberger and help him connect with Sabu, but Sabu
never showed. However, given the major hacks that had just
occurred, Sabu’s absence seemed more like an indication that
he was being careful rather than chickening out.
The next day, and despite the no-show, I decided to make
one last effort to see Sabu. I wanted to give him a small gift
before I left NYC, the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. I
went downstairs and called Sabu, asking whether he would
come by the next day to pick it up before my partner and I 
left for Canada. After the wet and miserable failures of the
day before, I had serious doubts that he would show up. But
Sabu did not disappoint. As my partner and I sat in our car,
just minutes before our planned departure time, a huge black
pickup truck loaded with guys rolled up, and Sabu hopped
out. I went out to meet him. He was in a rush and we were too,
so our exchange lasted less than ten minutes. I gave him the
book and wished him well. He walked over to our car and my
partner rolled down the window. I introduced them (avoiding,
as per protocol, any reference to “Sabu” or any other name;
he never offered his real one). They shook hands as our scruffy
dog looked on. It was the last time I would see Sabu in person.
Back to the Classics
Anonymous activity would soar to new heights over the next
three months. AntiSec was still sitting on the full Stratfor
email spool, providing nibbles here and there in taunting press
releases. Meanwhile, Barrett Brown continued to beg for the
emails, and relations between him and the crew became tense.
Hammond explained that some AntiSec members at the time
“did not like BB [Brown] for many of the same personalityego-tripping reasons that are already well known.” A few were
especially upset that he had tweeted about the release before
it was made public.
They decided to give the cache to WikiLeaks. Hammond
simply went to the WikiLeaks IRC server (largely behind Sabu’s
back) and the deal was done. “When talking to WikiLeaks,”
Hammond recounted to me, “they first asked to authenticate
the leak by pasting them some samples, which I did, [but] they
didn’t ask who I was or even really how I got access to it, but I
told them voluntarily that I was working with AntiSec and had
hacked Stratfor.” Soon after, he arranged the handoff. When
Sabu found out, he insisted on dealing with Assange personally. After all, he told Hammond, he was already in contact
The Sabutage 345
346 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
with Assange’s trusted assistant “Q.” (Later, Wired.com’s
Kevin Poulsen broke a story about Q, an Icelandic teenager,
Sigurdur “Siggi” Thordarson, who voluntarily became an FBI
informant in August 2011, handing thousands of WikiLeaks
chats and documents over to law enforcement in the process.
He did it, reportedly, for “the adventure.”)9
 Sabu entered into
“conversations with WL about getting some cash for the
leaks,” according to Hammond, but by that time WikiLeaks
already had the documents and were well on their way to processing them for release. In just two months the public would
see the emails for themselves.
As the hubbub over the credit card donations simmered
down around mid-January, the populist face of Anonymous
reemerged in reaction to the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).
The far-reaching US copyright bill was unpopular, and not
only among civil libertarians. The digerati and Silicon Valley
elite also came out against it. SOPA called for, among other
things, Google and other search engines to prevent flagged
sites like the Pirate Bay from showing up in search results. A
massive and elaborate outpouring of dissent ensured the bill’s
unraveling well before it could pass into law. The linchpin was
a “Blackout Day” held on January 18, 2012—a web-based
protest of unprecedented scale. A handful of large Internet
companies, several public interest groups, and thousands of
individuals programmed their websites to display only black,
with links urging visitors to write their representatives to
express opposition to SOPA. Around seventy-five thousand
webpages went dark, including dozens of prominent corporate and nonprofit websites such as Wikipedia, Flickr, Wired,
4chan, and Google.10 Journalists also wrote a torrent of articles. Less than a week later, SOPA and its Senate counterpart,
PIPA, were effectively scrapped—by being tabled indefinitely.
In the end, CBS News described the number of participants as
“staggering”: 4.5 million people signed a petition circulated
by Google; 350,000 citizens wrote to their representatives
via SopaStrike.com and AmericanCensorship.org; over 2.4 
million SOPA-related tweets were written on January 18
alone; and an online White House petition garnered 103,785
names.11 In response to the petition, the government officially announced the bill’s demise: “Moving forward, we will
continue to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis on legislation that provides new tools needed in the global fight
against piracy and counterfeiting, while vigorously defending
an open Internet based on the values of free expression, privacy,
security and innovation.”12
Corporate giants like Google, respected Internet personalities like Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales, and civil liberties
organizations like the EFF were all integral to the victory. But
the grassroots geek and hacker contingent was also present—
including, of course, Anonymous. They churned out videos and
propaganda posters, and provided constant updates on several
prominent Twitter accounts. When the blackout ended, corporate players quickly receded from the limelight. Anonymous
and others, however, continued the seemingly endless fight.
Just the next day, in fact, on January 19, 2012, federal
authorities orchestrated the takedown of popular file-sharing
site Megaupload. The company’s gregarious and controversial founder, Kim Dotcom, was arrested in a dramatic early
morning raid in New Zealand. The removal of this popular
website was received ominously by Anonymous activists.
Although SOPA had nothing to do with Dotcom’s arrest, it
was a reminder of the enormous regulatory power that copyright industries could wield over web content, with or without
formal legal backing: even though no court had yet found
Dotcom guilty of piracy, his property was confiscated and his
website knocked off the Internet. (While Dotcom’s case is still
ongoing at the time of writing, the prime minister of New
Zealand, John Key, has issued a formal apology for illegal surveillance leading up to the dramatic raid on Dotcom’s house,
which involved two helicopters and seventy-six officers.13)
As soon as the news broke, Anonymous retaliated with
its largest DDoS campaign to date, downing the homepages
The Sabutage 347
348 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
of Universal Music, the FBI, the US Copyright Office, the
Recording Industry Association of America, and the Motion
Picture Association of America, among others—entities, all,
which sought to stamp out illegal file sharing. Anonymous
and AnonOps changed up their tactics, opting for a different
tool than LOIC. This new tool, called PyLoris, was both more
cleverly designed and also more powerful; most importantly, it
protected the privacy of its user. It worked by making an incomplete connection to the target server and then holding it open
for a very long time. Normally, a server has only so many available “slots” for accepting connections. But if the connection
is only partially set up, the slot will wait, refusing subsequent
connections in the interim. With enough people making and
maintaining these incomplete connections, the server’s available slots become filled and service is effectively denied.
It all unfolded like the best old-school ops, with the software available to download from a link in the IRC channel
topic and the targets announced to the channel for the several
thousand people who opted into the attack. Links also pointed
to guides on how to better anonymize one’s connections using
Tor and VPNs.
Just a few weeks later, in Europe, as massive online and offline
demonstrations unfolded against the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement (ACTA), another international copyright
agreement, Anonymous again appeared. Following the Polish
government’s agreement to ratify ACTA, Anonymous took
down a slew of their websites and began to heavily publicize
the street protests sweeping Krakow. Soon after, Poland’s leftleaning Palikot’s Movement party donned Guy Fawkes masks
during a parliamentary hearing on ACTA—the first, and so
far the only, time elected officials adopted the revolutionary
symbol. Amid this and many other outcries, the European parliament rejected the proposed law in July 2012.
Afterwards, one of the old-guard Anons, who had been a
member of #command as far back as the fall of 2010, reached
out to me with the following assessment:
<h>: at the moment it seems as if there is a whole new group of people
<h>: not connected to #antisec [and] working as hard as ever
<h>: which makes me happy and proud of people
<biella>: yea
<biella>: here and a few other places
<biella>: it is good
<h>: and when i saw those polish politicians
<h>: with masks on
<biella>: yea unreal
<h>: I realised that us bunch of motley fools have actually entered the
worlds conscious[ness]
<h>: and in some small way are changing things
<h>: :D
As an insider, it’s natural that he would seek to puff up
Anonymous. But that wasn’t all that was going on—his assessment of the group’s increasing power seemed accurate. Not long
after this exchange, I received a call from a venture capitalist
who had helped organize some of the protests against SOPA.
He wanted to learn more about how Anonymous operated
behind the scenes. The group seemed to pop up unpredictably,
he remarked, before musing on the possibility that an outsider
contacting and harnessing it toward other fights for Internet
freedom. It felt a bit gross—one of Anonymous’s core principles is that it will not be anybody’s “personal army”—but,
if nothing else, his interest demonstrated the accuracy of h’s
intuition: Anonymous had become an important, recognized,
and potent component of the global political mix.
“Admit nothing, deny everything and
make counter-accusations”
On February 27, WikiLeaks distributed the Stratfor emails,
labeling them “The Global Intelligence Files.” Opinions over
their political significance varied. A small cohort of journalists,
The Sabutage 349
350 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
security specialists, and even some of Stratfor’s own customers reacted with a mere “meh.” Scant evidence of outrageous
or illegal behavior was contained in the emails, they asserted.
This blasé reaction was colored by the less-than-stellar reputation already enjoyed by Stratfor at the time of the release.
Many viewed the company, frankly, as rip-off artists: “Stratfor
Is a Joke and So Is Wikileaks for Taking It Seriously” was the
insulting headline proffered by Max Fisher in The Atlantic.
14
For an exorbitant fee (up to $40,000 per annum in 2001),
Stratfor subscribers received a newsletter, which Fisher said
contained little more than rehashed news. Of course, the firm’s
reputation only plunged further when it was revealed it never
bothered to encrypt its subscribers’ credit card information.
Other journalists and members of the public found the emails
to be politically potent, however, providing solid nuggets of
proof that Stratfor profited from morally dubious practices,
such as corporate propaganda dressed as public relations and
the monitoring of activists. The Stratfor emails are indeed
revealing—and occasionally prescient. Take, for instance, the
following excerpt from a lengthier email typed, remarkably,
on an iPhone on December 10, 2010:
The chaners/anon/b are educated and at the leading edge
of network based technology, have a nebulous structure of
loyal people spread through the world with no nationalistic
foundations bit [sic] drawn together under a shared interest
in chaos (hentai and cats, for fuck sake). There are numerous examples where they have uncovered identities and
all personal details of people based on a single photo (of
a woman putting a cat in a garbage bin for example) and
bought [sic] some serious vigilanty style justice to those they
disagree with …
It’s going to be very interesting to watch what anon does in
the ‘post-wilileaks’ environment. If they move from a bunch
of tech geeks in mum’s basement into a real movement they
could cause serious trouble and be hard to kill. The coresy 
[sic] not be the problem but the few unhinged among them
could prove to be quite destructive if so inclined.15
Journalist Steve Horn sifted through thousands of Stratfor
emails and wrote a two-part series examining the tactics
deployed by the firm and its predecessors, Mongoven, Biscoe
and Duchin (MBD) and Pagan. The founder of MBD, Ronald
Duchin—a military man with extensive work experience in
public relations—devised the “Duchin formula”: “isolate
the radicals, ‘cultivate’ the idealists and ‘educate’ them into
becoming realists. Then co-opt the realists in agreeing with
industry.” Horn notes that this strategy “is still employed to
this day by Stratfor.”16
The majority of company emails show that “the most
important service Stratfor provides is its sociological analysis in service to corporate power and capital, not the dirty
on-the-ground work,” according to Horn.17 A smattering of
emails also point to more direct involvement in the monitoring of activists. A 1984 explosion at a Union Carbide India
Ltd. plant in Bhopal, India—one of the worst industrial disasters of the twentieth century—left thousands dead and
over 500,000 exposed to deadly chemicals. Dow Chemical,
who purchased Union Carbide, hired Stratfor to keep tabs
on various activist groups, such as the Yes Men and Bhopal
Medical Appeal, which were publicizing the issue or assisting
victims. The documents revealed that Coca-Cola hired Stratfor
to watch the environmental group PETA, particularly its operations in Canada in the lead-up to the Vancouver Olympics.
And Stratfor sent an employee, self-described in an email
as “U/C” (undercover), to infiltrate the local Occupy group
in Austin, Texas, with the goal of gathering organizational
intelligence—tracking the occupiers’ movements and identifying possible ties with environmental activists:
There is a group you may be familiar with called Deep
Green Resistance … Whether anyone in the Fed or elsewhere
The Sabutage 351
352 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
classifies this group as eco-terror or not, I don’t know, but
they are nothing but and should be watched … The local
Austin chapter was part of the Occupy Austin crowd at city
hall, however, things were not “radical” enough for them
since they do not believe in working within the system.
When I was working U/C on Nov. 5th, some of my contacts
told me that at the General Assembly on Nov. 4th, there
was some conflict between regular Occupy people and Deep
Green.18
These examples harken back to the issues raised in Chapter
7 regarding the HBGary and HBGary Federal e-mails which,
among other suggestions both creepy and invasive, contained a
proposal to discredit WikiLeaks. Information about corporate
espionage, even with these emails, is still scant. Still, between
emerging examples of abuse and the difficulty in accessing
corporate records, we should, at a minimum, be troubled by
cozy ties revealed between private industry and government.
If indeed—as one email purports—Stratfor’s vice president of
intelligence, Fred Burton, lives by the code “Admit nothing,
deny everything and make counter-accusations,” then we can
see the importance of the leaks and whistleblowing activites of
Anonymous and its ilk.
Stratfor issued this statement about the authenticity of the
leaked emails:
Some of the emails may be forged or altered to include
inaccuracies; some may be authentic. We will not validate
either. Nor will we explain the thinking that went into them.
Having had our property stolen, we will not be victimized
twice by submitting to questioning about them.19
Stratfor did, however, comment on two emails that were subsequently widely accepted as frauds: a letter of resignation from
Stratfor’s founder, CIO, and CEO, George Friedman, which
AntiSec wrote, and a fraudulent email purportedly sent to all 
Stratfor customers offering a free subscription to the company’s newsletter as a peace offering and apology for the breach.
“I needed the truth out there”
Around this time, Sabu became more cocky and defiant in
public than ever. In early February, in response to a critic asking
about the status of Syrian emails that AntiSec was rumored to
have, Sabu barked: “You’ll eat your words once we decide to
leak what we have. We don’t give a fuck about governments.
We give a fuck about people.”20 I had not talked to him on the
phone since moving to Canada. This wasn’t only due to the
logistics of moving; calling from an outdoor payphone in the
middle of a Montreal winter put one at risk of frostbite. But
early in the morning on March 6, Sabu kept harassing me on
Twitter. He didn’t care how I contacted him, as long as I did
it, and as soon as possible. I picked up my home phone and
called him.
It was as if he started talking before even picking up the
phone: “Fox is going to publish a story about me and the FBI.”
Sabu explained that the story was slated to go live in just a few
minutes. He said that he wanted to explain some things before
I read it. Distraught, he said that Fox had “stooped so low” to
get at him and his family, but he refused to tell me just what
they had done. He said only, “It’s not what you think it is.” My
head spun throughout it all; I grew dizzy. I remember being
angry, and having difficulty verbalizing what I was feeling or
remembering what he said. And then, somehow, the conversation ended.
As it turned out, there was not one but three stories about
Hector Xavier Monsegur, each featuring a giant picture of his
face as he sat in front of a computer. There it was: Sabu’s
cooperation with the FBI. This is what he had been trying to
tell me on the phone. I was dumbstruck. The news coincided
with a string of indictments also detailed in the articles. In
The Sabutage 353
354 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
the US, the FBI had just arrested Jeremy Hammond, while
in the UK and Ireland, Ryan Ackroyd (Kayla), Donncha
O’Cearbhaill (Palladium), and Darren Martyn (pwnsauce)
were each indicted on computer conspiracy charges.
The news rolled through the different IRC channels like
a shock wave. The CabinCr3w channel hosted a number of
people who were very close to Sabu (pseudonyms have been
altered):

Nacho-King was right. While everyone felt the bitter sting of
betrayal, a minority still supported Sabu. The Fox News article
had, indeed, reported that the FBI dangled a time-honored ultimatum in front of Sabu: he could work for the G-men or have
his adopted cousins forcibly removed from his care. Eventually,
a number of former Anonymous participants—more hangerson than hardcore hackers—told me that Sabu had been telling
them back in the summer of 2011 “to get the fuck out.” It
started to become clear why Sabu had been cozying up with
the Anons who possessed the hacking skills to enter systems,
and not bothering with those who weren’t breaking the law.
He was targeting those of most interest to the FBI.
A few hours later, a dominant attitude was emerging on
the channels, one which echoed the sentiment of an unnamed
government official quoted in the Fox report: “You might be a
messiah in the hacking community but you’re still a rat.”
By the end of the day, Sabu’s reputation within Anonymous
was irrevocably tarnished. And as the news reverberated
throughout the Inter-tubes, howls of anger and pangs of
betrayal sounded. It took a month before my own anger had
receded enough that I could have another conversation with
him. He was at his most defiant, opening our conversation
with the salvo that he was “disappointed that no one questioned the news report.” Then he growled in disbelief at being
treated like a “biohazard.”
The Sabutage 355
356 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
“I protected hundreds of people,” he insisted. “I saved a lot
of asses. When you have kids, you have to choose. I did the
right thing.” His only plea for sympathy concerned the fact
that he himself faced penalties. He had been arrested, after
all, and maintained his liberty only on bail—it remained likely
that he would still face ten or fifteen years in prison. Not
knowing one’s fate is “stressful,” he declared. When I asked
him how much of what he did and said was directed by the
FBI, he barked, “Everything I said on Twitter was my motherfucking point of view.” He added later, “I was genuine with
my tweets, no one dictated what I wrote.” This directly contradicts statements made by one of his handlers as reported
by Jana Winter for Fox News. “About 90 percent of what you
see online is bulls—,”21 said the handler, in reference both to
posts from Sabu’s Twitter account and also “interviews” he
gave to the press. Whether this is the truth or an even more
elaborate, recursive disinformation campaign, the implication
is that Sabu parroted whatever the FBI wanted him to say.
There were some tweets—“If god forbid I am arrested, I’ll
admit to my crimes, and take myself down. I do not believe
in bringing others down for my own sins. Thanks”—that we
now know were unadulterated nuggets of FBI-influenced BS.22
I barely got a word in edgewise, but I did manage to ask
Sabu whether he met me at the behest of the FBI. His voice
became louder in dismissal. “Jesus Christ! You don’t need to
ask permission to go to fucking Chipotle and get a burrito!”
Unsatisfied, I asked him again why he reached out to me, and
I asked a further question about the catalyst of our meeting—
the hacker at the NYSEC meet-up. He began brushing this
off, before suddenly stopping short. “I needed the truth out
there one way or another,” he stated clearly. “The more time
we spent, the more I felt I could confide in you. It is a shitty
situation.”
He let loose one final deluge of vitriol: “I expected the nerds
to expose my family, but not the media. For the media to post
shit on my family!” He added: “There are many informants 
in Anonymous.” Then he wrapped up with some shout-outs,
giving props to “Jeremy and Donncha”—two of the most
technically savvy and hardworking hackers in Anonymous,
who had themselves refused to offer anything to law enforcement (and whose capture had largely been the result of his
actions). Then he offered a few parting words: “I still think the
idea of Anonymous is beautiful. Decentralization is power.”
Law Breaking and Snitches
Around this time, Anonymous participants and some independent journalists like Nigel Parry began raising questions
about the official story that had coalesced around the Stratfor
hack. On March 25, 2012, Parry penned a detailed blog post
titled “Sacrificing Stratfor: How the FBI Waited Three Weeks
to Close the Stable Door.”23 He noted how bizarre it was that
Stratfor’s thorough pwning could occur right under the FBI’s
nose. After all, the FBI maintained—both in court documents
and to the Fox reporter—that Monsegur was on the tightest
of leashes the whole time. “The FBI,” wrote Jana Winter, “has
had an agent watching his online activity twenty-four hours a
day, officials said.”24
Monsegur provided the FBI with direct, real-time access
to unfolding developments, and the FBI informed Stratfor of
the intrusion almost immediately, in early December. AntiSec
only had access to the customer database at this time. It took
another ten days for Hammond to infiltrate the rest of the
system; Hammond didn’t delete the data for another ten days,
on Christmas Eve. Stratfor had ample opportunity to step up
its security or, if nothing else, back up its data. But it did not. In
the aftermath of this hacking blitz, George Friedman, Stratfor’s
CEO, provided the following vague explanation: “We worked
to improve our security infrastructure within the confines of
time and the desire to protect the investigation by not letting
the attackers know that we knew of their intrusion.”25
The Sabutage 357
358 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
By November 2013, publicly accessible court records had
confirmed Hammond’s timeline. And yet, for over two years no
other journalist had bothered to press Stratfor on its failure to
take additional protective measures after the initial intrusion.
Nor did they question why the FBI waited until December 24
to deliver Stratfor a second wave of bad tidings—that emails
had been downloaded and data was being wiped—when it
knew full well that AntiSec had gained wider access days
earlier.
The FBI’s rationalization for its actions does little to clarify
the situation. As Nicole Perlroth of the New York Times
reported: “The F.B.I. said that it immediately notified Stratfor,
but said that at that point it was too late. Over the next several
weeks, hackers rummaged through Stratfor’s financial information, email correspondence and subscribers’ personal and
financial information, occasionally deleting its most valuable
data—all in full view of F.B.I. agents.”26
Then, in May 2014, an astonishing bevy of court documents—chat logs, surveillance photos, and government
documents from Hammond’s court case—were leaked to
journalists Dell Cameron and Daniel Stuckey. Armed with
them, they were able to corroborate Hammond’s timeline at
a more granular level. The chat logs in particular go a long
way toward confirming, as Cameron wrote, “longstanding
accusations that federal investigators allowed an informant
to repeatedly break computer-crime laws while in pursuit of
Hammond and other Anonymous figures.”27
Allegations that Sabu aided and abetted illegal activity
(recall that it was Sabu who brought the Stratfor vulnerability
to Hammond in the first place) were not limited to the Stratfor
hack. During Hammond’s sentencing hearing in November
2014, he read a statement that included another explosive
accusation:
After Stratfor, I continued to break into other targets, using
a powerful “zero day exploit” allowing me administrator 
access to systems running the popular Plesk webhosting platform. Sabu asked me many times for access to this exploit,
which I refused to give him. Without his own independent
access, Sabu continued to supply me with lists of vulnerable targets. I broke into numerous websites he supplied,
uploaded the stolen email accounts and databases onto
Sabu’s FBI server, and handed over passwords and backdoors that enabled Sabu (and, by extension, his FBI handlers)
to control these targets. These intrusions, all of which were
suggested by Sabu while cooperating with the FBI, affected
thousands of domain names and consisted largely of foreign
government websites, including Brazil, Turkey, Syria.28
As Hammond was about to mention more government targets,
Judge Preska implored him: “Mr. Hammond, we just spoke
about those countries being redacted, I’d appreciate if you
didn’t use them.” In his statement, Hammond also reminded
the court of the existence of some evidence backing his claims:
All of this happened under the control and supervision of
the FBI and can be easily confirmed by chat logs the government provided to us pursuant to the government’s discovery
obligations in the case against me … Because I pled guilty,
I do not have access to many documents that might have
been provided to me in advance of trial, such as Sabu’s communications with the FBI. In addition, the majority of the
documents provided to me are under a “protective order”
which insulates this material from public scrutiny.
Hammond’s statement was republished online, with some
websites redacting the names of the countries mentioned and
others including them. Having been told about these hacks
earlier during my first prison visit, I became intrigued about
how much truth might lie behind Hammond’s claims. I raised
these questions to some journalists and convinced one to
track them down. Eventually, this culminated in a front-page
The Sabutage 359
360 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
New York Times story by Mark Mazzetti in late April 2014,
entitled “F.B.I. Informant Is Tied to Cyberattacks Abroad.”29
Then, after the trove of court documents under protective
order were leaked, journalists Daniel Stuckey and Blake wrote
a detailed play-by-play of Sabu’s role in orchestrating hacks
against the Brazilian government and various corporate websites. Although many of Sabu’s targets were threaded through
Hammond, he also offered vulnerabilities to other hackers.
In one documented case, he offered a valuable exploit which
“opened backdoors to hundreds of Brazilian websites.”30 And
all of this was performed under the FBI’s careful gaze.
The news that the FBI allowed—or at least abided—Sabu’s
role in facilitating an illegal hacking spree struck many in
Anonymous as a perverse abuse of power. Of course, we don’t
know—and likely never will—whether Sabu’s services were
loaned out by the FBI to other three-letter agencies for military
ops or intelligence gathering, whether his actions furthered
the governments own purposes in some roundabout way, or
whether other factors were at work; but when this example
is contextualized within the broader American informant
system, it becomes clear that the scenario is far from unusual.
Law professor Alexandra Natapoff argues that corrupt
relations between informants and their handlers are not sporadic, exceptional activities—they are endemic. In her book
Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American
Justice, she persuasively illustrates a twisted system that often
results in increased cycles of crime and violence. The FBI routinely allows its informants to break the law, Natapoff argues,
so long as they are otherwise cooperative. While informants
are a necessary tool for the criminal justice system, she concludes that in the program’s present configuration, “informant
use inflicts significant wounds on the integrity of the criminal
process.”31
Natapoff and other journalists have documented numerous
cases of abuse. For instance, in 2005, Yassine Ouassif, a parttime engineering student living in the Bay Area, was escorted 
off a plane in Paris headed for San Francisco. Despite holding
a green card and not being under investigation, he was interrogated for hours in a US Customs and Border Protection facility.
Ultimately, an FBI agent offered a choice: become an informant in the Muslim-American community or face deportation
to his home country Morocco.32 A lawsuit filed in April 2014
on behalf of four Muslim men alleges that the FBI placed or
kept them on a no-fly list after they refused to spy on Muslim
communities in New York, New Jersey, and Nebraska.33 This
sort of bullying aims to intervene directly into a community,
changing its very nature without having formally established
any wrongdoing.
The majority of cases involving informants never go to trial
in the United States, so we only learn about this system—
and are able to argue for its reform—thanks to occasional
trials and leaks (a reminder of how the Hammond court case
leak can serve the democratic process). The fact that Sabu
was allowed to facilitate so many hacks under full view of
the FBI is testament to the ongoing abuses of the informant
system. It also serves as a painful reminder that the state will
use methods both legal and illegal to dismantle a movement
deemed threatening.
“Trust no one on IRC, ever”
As the news rumbled about Sabu’s informant status, it became
apparent that while Monsegur’s cooperation had made a decisive difference, many participants had neglected to properly
secure their information. Anonymous9 expressed it to me
this way: “The fact that people got arrested because of him is
partially because he was a traitor, and partially because those
people were careless. If they hadn’t shared personal information with him they would have been fine. Sort of comes back
to the whole ‘trust no one on IRC, ever’ thing.”
It may be hard to prove computer crimes after they have
The Sabutage 361
362 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
been committed, unless data—such as credit card numbers,
emails, or other incriminating information—is found on a suspect’s computer. But as computer security researcher Robert
Graham put it, chat logs culled by an informant can be used to
“convict you of conspiracy, intent, obstruction of justice [and]
racketeering.”34 And the prosecution had an enormous hunk
of logs from which to build its case. Still, having Sabu around
was not enough to nab everyone—some members of AntiSec
and LulzSec remain out of reach of the law. Had others been
more careful with their operational security, they may have
never been caught.
How were mistakes made? Hammond practiced nearly
flawless technical operational security, but in chats he revealed
personal details. The most significant—which I had seen him
mention once in public and once in a private channel—was
that he had spent time in federal prison. Given one of his main
nicknames, “Anarchaos,” his unique status as one of the only
bona fide American anarchist hackers to have done time in US
prison must have placed him pretty high on the list of candidates. Perhaps the one vital task that Sabu performed for the
FBI here was to connect Hammond’s potpourri of different
nicknames. Below is a snippet of a conversation, filed in the
court documents, between Sabu (as “CW-1”) and Hammond
(as “@sup_g”) on Christmas Day:
<CW-1>: hows the news looking?
<@sup_g>: I been going hard all night
<CW-1>: I heard we’re all over the news papers
<CW-1>: you mother fuckers are going to get me raied [raided]
<CW-1>: HAHAHAAHA
<@sup_g>: we put out 30k cards, the it.stratfor.com dump, and
another statement
<@sup_g>: dude it’s big
<CW-1>: if I get raided anarchaos your job is to cause havok in my
honor
<CW-1>: <3
<CW-1>: sup_g:
<@sup_g>: it shall be so
Of course, Sabu proved crucial to the investigations in many
other ways: one LulzSec member shared a link to a home-brewed
video he hosted on YouTube. With the URL, the authorities
sent a subpoena to YouTube for the account’s email address,
and from there it was trivial to connect his Facebook account.
This young hacker had made the grave mistake of uploading
incriminating screenshots of a web defacement, which were
then shared with another member of LulzSec (oy vey).
Anonymous9’s suggestion to “trust no one on IRC” is
much easier said than done. The “Sabutage,” as one person
humorously referred to it, cut so deep because Anonymous,
like almost every political movement, was underwritten by
friendships and the flourishing of more intimate relationships still. Marriages, like the one between the young hacker
John Anthony Borell III (Kahuna), from the CabinCr3w, and
Sarah Borell, were indebted to chats in the crew’s private IRC
channel. Topiary shepherded one of his LulzSec mates through
a dark period of his life. Even those who never shared personally identifying information were interpolated into strong,
lasting bonds. Such connections make it all too tempting, and
easy, to be lulled into a state of comfort wherein one betrays
their identity by oversharing. Even if one recognizes that this is
happening, it is not as simple as simply changing a nickname,
scrubbing all markers of the previous identity, and adopting a
different style of talk. Parmy Olson highlights this “dilemma”
constantly faced by hackers: changing a nick means losing
the stable marker of identity and reputation crucial to hacker
coworking across time.35
A few years later, I asked some Anons why—given creeping
suspicions that he was an informant—Sabu was not only tolerated but actually advanced as AntiSec’s public-facing persona.
For O’Cearbhaill, one of the other AntiSec Anons, his charisma did the trick. Like no one else he was able to rouse public
The Sabutage 363
364 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
passion with his clarion calls for uprising. Another plausible
explanation was advanced by numerous other participants:
another figure, Yettie (not his real pseudonym), was himself,
for much of the time, a target of copious snitching accusations, which drew attention away from Sabu. At least a dozen
core participants had shared with me their fears about Yettie.
He had managed to gain access to countless IRC servers and
was known for playing with many people’s minds—including, I felt, my own. Even Hammond, momentarily operating
under the handle “crediblethreat,” called him to the mat in
an uncommon public display of internal strife in the fall
of 2011:
<crediblethreat>: hey Yettie
<crediblethreat>: did you tell everybody
<crediblethreat>: about how and why you were kicked out of antisec
core team?
<crediblethreat>: where were you for all these months?
[…]
<crediblethreat>: why the fuck should anyone trust you again, snitch?
To this day no one can definitely say whether Yettie is an
informant (or merely creepy). Many others were also accused.
Rumors like these are endlessly analyzed in light of what is
deemed odd behavior and the scant factual information available to participants. For instance, leaked law-enforcement
documents name a “CW-2” (confidential witness 2), implying that there were at least two informants milling around.36
Many participants also asked why some hackers and participants embedded in the secret channels were never raided or
questioned once they decided to go public. These rumors and
uncertainties propel the stormy and disorienting atmospherics
of paranoia so common in the context of leftist or progressive political movements. Once the fog of fear and confusion
settles, it makes it “difficult to sort out paranoia from reality,
imaginary enemies from perfectly real ones,” in the words of 
Ruth Rosen, who chronicled FBI-induced fear in the 1960s
women’s liberation movement.37
Sabu’s outing also functioned as a test, pushing Anonymous
into a period of introspection. For weeks, as Anons wailed,
raged, assessed, reassessed, and freaked out on Twitter and
various IRC networks, they wondered what future—if any—
remained for Anonymous after such a blow. Would it come to
pass, to quote an anonymous government official featured in
Winter’s Fox News article, that “when people in the hacking
community realize their God has actually been cooperation
[sic] with the government, it’ll be sheer terror”?
Knock Knock, We’re Here
While the Sabutage fanned the flames of paranoia, it did not
spell the end of Anonymous—or even really cultivate a substantial amount of terror. Even if Anonymous could never
replicate the high participant levels of its LulzSec/AntiSec days
(back when Fox News’ description of them as “hackers on
steroids” was apt), Anonymous carried along just fine through
2012 and much of 2013, executing major hacks and attacks
across the world. Its formidable reputation is best illustrated
by an anecdote from the highest echelons of US officialdom.
In 2012, Barack Obama’s reelection campaign team
assembled a group of programmers, system administrators,
mathematicians, and data scientists to fine-tune voter targeting. Journalists praised Obama’s star-studded and maverick
technology team, detailing its members’ hard work, success,
and travails, and ultimately heralding the system as a success.
These articles, however, failed to report one of the team’s big
concerns. Throughout the campaign, the technologists had
treated Anonymous as a potentially even bigger nuisance than
the foreign state hackers who had infiltrated the McCain and
Obama campaigns in 2008.38
In late November 2012, Asher Wolf, a geek crusader who
The Sabutage 365
366 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
acted as a sometimes-informal adviser to Anonymous, noticed
that Harper Reed, the chief technologist for Obama’s reelection tech team, followed @AnonyOps on Twitter. Much like a
trickster, Wolf pointed this out to AnonyOps, suggesting, “let’s
play with that and see what we can do.”39
AnonyOps sent Reed a private Twitter message. “Hi. The
next few months are big. I thought we should maybe chat.”
Reed read the message and his “heart sank,” as he explained
it to me in an interview. He reached out to his boss, the chief
information officer, and the head of security for the Obama
campaign. They hammered out a variety of possible 140 character replies. Finally, they hit on this bit of genius: “Hey. What’s
on your mind?” As Harper was about to send the message, the
chief information officer, who had been speaking with senior
lawyers for the campaign, bolted over to Harper’s desk to
stop him. They had changed their mind. The best response,
they determined, was no response at all. He came seconds
too late.
Had Reed known what I did, he would have been spared
a day or two of anxiety. AnonyOps was simply interested in
initiating a conversation with an influential political figure.
Reflecting back on the event during an interview with me,
Wolf recalled that
it was amusing, because we were like kids, playing with
boundaries … with the world’s superpower. We’d been
through 2010 when the screens poured with rage as the
administration went after WikiLeaks and we’d gone through
Occupy … We’d seen people be jailed, disappear … Maybe,
just maybe we were a little fatalistic. And maybe it felt good
once, just once to wander up close to the administration that
drones small children and flick a cigarette butt in their faces.
As this incident shows, Anonymous had become a specter; its
influence had grown so far-reaching that it didn’t even have to
do anything to have an effect. It is understandable why Obama’s 
reelection team felt perturbed by this ambiguous knock on its
digital door. In the two months following Hammond’s arrest,
Anonymous hacked into hundreds of Chinese government
websites; knocked the website for Formula One racing offline
after the repressive government of Bahrain, set to host the next
Formula One race, had detained and imprisoned protesters;
and hacked into the website of the Greek finance ministry,
drawing attention to the government’s plan to track citizens’
bank information in an effort to curtail tax fraud. Over the
summer of 2012, Anonymous launched another major hack
(again) against the Formula One website, this time coinciding with the Montreal Grand Prix; this was done to protest
Bill 78, a controversial measure passed in Quebec to curtail
protest activity, which had soared after proposed tuition hikes.
Quebec’s Human Rights Commission issued a fifty-six page
report condemning the bill for its flagrant violation of the
province’s own human rights charter, notably for the provision
that threatened to fine protesters thousands of dollars if they
failed to notify authorities at least eight hours in advance of the
itinerary of any protest involving fifty or more people.40 Later
that month in India, after a Supreme Court order mandated
that local ISPs block torrent websites, file-sharing websites,
and even some video-sharing websites, Anonymous retaliated by DDoSing the Indian Supreme Court, the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology, the Department
of Telecommunications, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the
Indian National Congress. Like many Anons, AnonOpsIndia
took to Twitter to make its views heard: “We will become a
#PAIN in the #ASS for the government until they stop #censoring our #INTERNET[.] IT BELONGS TO US!”41
Anonymous continued unabated in 2013, remaining committed to ongoing issues, as in #OpLastResort, a series of
retributive hacks carried out against the websites of MIT, the
US Department of Justice, and the US Sentencing Commission
following the suicide of Internet pioneer and activist Aaron
Swartz. His family and many admirers felt that his suicide at
The Sabutage 367
368 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
age twenty-six was a political act borne out of a sense of desperation fueled by his impending trial. Swartz faced thirty-five
years in jail and $1 million in fines—simply for downloading a
cache of academic journal articles he never released. “Aaron’s
death … is the product of a criminal justice system rife with
intimidation and prosecutorial overreach,” wrote his family
and partner.42 In the video accompanying their hacks and
website defacements, Anonymous echoed this assessment:
Two weeks ago today, a line was crossed. Two weeks ago
today, Aaron Swartz was killed. Killed because he faced an
impossible choice. Killed because he was forced into playing
a game he could not win—a twisted and distorted perversion of justice—a game where the only winning move was
not to play.43
While initially receiving scant media attention, a trio of North
American ops focusing on a recent spate of sexual assault and
rape allegations hooked American news-makers. Suddenly,
Anonymous was back on center stage. Once again in its preferred position, Anonymous managed to stimulate public debate
on an issue too often treated as a mere tantalizing spectacle.
The first case, originating in Steubenville, Ohio, concerned two members of a high school football team facing
trial for raping a classmate. The night of the assault, other
team members snapped photos of and filmed the unconscious
woman, promptly sharing them on social media with sickening celebratory statements. One video, eventually sent to
Anonymous, featured a classmate boasting that “they raped
her harder than that cop raped Marcellus Wallace in Pulp
Fiction … That’s how you know she’s dead, because someone
pissed on her.”44
In December of 2012, while local Steubenville activist Michelle McKee asserted that a fair trial was impossible
in a town that treated the football players as demigods, she
reached out to Anonymous and they swooped in. An Anon 
who had recently taken up the handle “KYAnonymous” (his
real name is Deric Lostutter) was at work exposing the identities of posters on revenge porn forums. Reading about the
Steubenville case incensed him, and he expressed as much on
Twitter. McKee sent him some incriminating material that had
circulated with social media accounts of individuals linked to
the event. KYAnonymous sprung into action, first releasing an
ominous video warning. David Kushner memorably described
it for Rolling Stone:
Like a deft poker player, Lostutter amped up his manifesto
with a bluff. He claimed that Anonymous had already doxed
“everyone involved” with the cover-up and crime—parents,
teachers, and kids—and were going to release their private
information online “unless all accused parties come forward
by New Years Day and issue a public apology to the girl and
her family.”45
By the next day, a hacker named Noah McHugh, who went
by “BatCat,” allegedly gained access to RollRedRoll.com, the
school’s sports web portal (named after its buff, red, devil-like
stallion mascot), and accessed team emails. KYAnonymous
tweeted nonstop while celebrities like Roseanne Barr added
their network effect to the cause. Then, on December 29, a
cold wintry day, Anonymous’s call for a street demonstration in Steubenville was answered by a throng of a thousand
demonstrators—with a now-requisite smattering of Guy
Fawkes masks. “In a dramatic turn, some of them spoke of
their own sexual assaults and rapes, removing their masks to
show themselves to the crowd,” wrote Kushner.
Anonymous remained hyperactively involved with the
Steubenville assault on Twitter, until two teenagers were
found guilty of rape in May 2013. One defendant received
the minimum sentence: one year in a juvenile correctional
facility. The other was sentenced to two years. In November
2013, four Steubenville residents, including the school
The Sabutage 369
370 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
superintendent, were subsequently charged for covering up
evidence of another, earlier rape case, according to the New
York Times.
46 The FBI raided Lostutter in June 2013, and he is
facing indictment under the CFAA; Noah McHugh was allegedly arrested earlier in February. If convicted, they face much
longer prison sentences than the rapists.
In April 2013, Anonymous got wind of the case of Rehtaeh
Parsons, a straight-A student who had ended her life after
what appears to have been a sexual assault at an alcoholfueled party in Halifax, Canada. The failure to prosecute any
of the accused boys, Anonymous charged, was due to inappropriate handling by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP). Anons helped raise awareness of the case with a
video and a press release demanding Nova Scotia RCMP take
immediate legal action against the individuals. Leah Parsons,
Rehtaeh’s mother, asked for justice to be brought by the
authorities, rather than online vigilantes. The Anons behind
#OpJustice4Rehtaeh respected this wish by making clear in a
subsequent statement that
We do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims.
That would mean we approve of violent actions against
these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob. What we want
is justice. And that’s your job. So do it. The names of the
rapists will be kept until it is apparent you have no intention
of providing justice to Retaeh’s family. Please be aware that
there are other groups of Anons also attempting to uncover
this information and they may not to wish to wait at all.
Better act fast.47
The RCMP reopened the case but downplayed Anonymous’s
role, insisting the new evidence “did not come from an online
source.”48Anonymous participants, along with some commentators, felt the masked activists had made a decisive difference:
“It’s entirely clear that the online pressure mattered a great
deal in this case,”49 noted Emily Bazelon of Slate. Parsons, 
initially ambivalent, was eventually thankful Anonymous had
intervened. In late August 2013, the RCMP charged the two
accused men with making and distributing child pornography
(the case is still pending).
The final of the three cases was another incident that never
went to trial because the prosecutors deemed there to be
insufficient evidence. This case involved a party in Maryville,
Missouri, after which seventeen-year-old Matthew Barnett
dropped off fourteen-year-old Daisy Coleman outside her
home, barely conscious, in a T-shirt and sweatpants, where she
passed out in sub-freezing weather. Two in-depth local investigative articles strongly suggested that there was actually more
than sufficient evidence to charge Barnett. Comparing the
situation to Steubenville, a piece by Peggy Lowe and Monica
Sanreckzi for Kansas City Public Media cited the local sheriff:
“Did a crime occur? Hell yes, it occurred. Was it a horrible
crime? Yes, it was a horrible crime. And did these boys need
to be punished for it? Absolutely.”50 When these articles were
brought to Anonymous’s attention, the group made a lot
of noise, in turn bringing the incident to the nation’s attention. Eventually, a special prosecutor formally filed a criminal
charge against Matthew Barnett—a single count of misdemeanor child endangerment.
Anonymous’s interventions in these three cases triggered
searing but divided responses. Citizens, journalists, and feminists disagreed over whether Anonymous’s interventions had
helped or hurt sexual abuse victims. Ariel Levy, in a scathing
New Yorker article, came down hard against the Anonymous
(and other online activists), asserting that the appeal of the
group was rooted in the public’s naive embrace of a simple
archetype: “modern-day Peter Parkers—computer nerds who
put on a costume and were transformed into superhero vigilantes.”51 Other responses were more nuanced, going beyond
the vigilante argument. During a Huffington Post Live video
interview, feminist author Jaclyn Friedman reflected on the
“double-edged sword” of Internet activism:
The Sabutage 371
372 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
The victim get victimized once, but they get revictimized when those images and videos are circulated among
their peers. But that can in some cases, as we saw with
Steubenville—with the help of Anonymous covering those
videos—become evidence, so that it is more likely that there
will be justice.52
Anonymous ignited a desperately needed national conversation about rape culture in the United States and Canada. In an
absorbing New York Times Magazine article, Bazelon identified a pattern in these three “white-knight ops,” a pattern
that also applies to a broader sample of Anonymous’s political operations, even those that steer clear of vigilantism:
when Anonymous jumps into the fray, it is typically due to
the group’s perception that justice is not being done; in many
cases, this turns out to be true.53 In a follow-up interview
the New York Times conducted with her about researching
Anonymous, Bazelon added,
I think each operation, or op, needs to be judged individually. Ones that have really responsible people working on
them are probably on balance a good thing. I think that
is true of Maryville and probably also of the one about
Rehtaeh Parsons, although that one is more fraught, because
there was an innocent person accused. Others really go off
the rails.
Indeed, Steubenville, which sparked the most media attention,
was in many respects the most poorly executed of the three
ops. Among other problems, the victim herself was doxed by
Anons, and locals were harassed. Many Anons were furious
at Lostutter for releasing the video (and, once outed, the fury
only intensified as he was seen to be behaving in a way deemed
as flagrantly self-promotional).
Two qualifications merit addition reflection. If vigilante
justice is rightly deemed problematic for skirting the legal 
process, it arises because existing channels for serving justice
are weak or nonexistent. All too often, critics point a finger at
the “vigilantes,” while ignoring or downplaying the more systemic conditions that in many ways give rise to them. Second,
teams are capable of adjustment. I witnessed this dynamic at
least a dozen times; after the mistakes made in the Steubenville
op, subsequent Anonymous engagements in rape cases were
approached with more delicacy, oversight, and care. Of
course, such responsiveness is itself fragile—working groups
within Anonymous are prone to dissolution. They might function well for three to six months, and then break up following
volcanic levels of internal feuding. (Bazelon covers in detail
the stormy bickering leading to the dissolution of one such
team.) They might then reconstitute later with new members
who have not internalized the same hard-learned lessons.
In contrast to other hacker and geek endeavors—like
Debian, the largest free software project in the world—
Anonymous has no established methodology through
which to encode itself as an institution. Only limited—and
provisional—protocols exist to perform the roles of adjudication, social reproduction, and mentoring. For instance,
IRC channels like #opnewblood, as its name suggests, serve
primarily pedagogical purposes. It is a space where newcomers learn the technical and cultural ropes. Certain Twitter
accounts, like @YourAnonNews—which at one time boasted
over twenty-five contributors who were required to follow a
style guide—are a mini-media institution (@YourAnonNews
has been criticized by some Anons as micro-imperialist).
Taking stock of the broader Anonymous constellation of
practices, we can derive a few fast and loose generalities.
Anons tend to forgo rigid regulatory codes in favor of ad hoc,
timely, and event-based responses. They even struggle with
institutional memory, even when Anons or the media memorialize the ops. To be sure, Anonymous exhibits significant
cultural cohesiveness, secured through all the videos, memes,
and other cultural lore the group produces; but at the same
The Sabutage 373
374 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
time, Anonymous either shuns or never implements transposable policies and mechanisms for handling operations. It is
not simply that Anons are allergic to formalization. Given that
each operation is so distinct, it may prove very difficult to
implement best practices in this dynamic milieu, even as we
can say that Anonymous does indeed learn from the past.
Of course, if all activist endeavors shunned institutionalization, many broader political goals would suffer. But feminist
scholar Larisa Mann identifies the strengths of flexible ad-hoc
political endeavors, arguing during an interview, “Anonymous
might be ahead of mainstream feminists in fighting small-town
rape culture.”54 She elaborated: in contrast to institutionalized
actors, Anonymous (along with other fleeting forms of disruptive activism) is free from the shackles of “self-promotion and
funding,” which are almost universally required for institutional endeavors. These requirements can prevent the sort of
nimble and swift response that Anonymous has elevated to a
high art.
If there is one conclusion to draw from a cursory review of
these cases, it is this: the work of politics and social transformation requires, and can bear, a diverse toolkit—from fine-tuned
government interventions to rowdy subversive tactics. We
should be wary of christening any particular approach as a
magic bullet. If forced to pick between an NGO that works
for women’s rights and Anonymous’s rough-and-tumble,
problematic intervention, I would likely pick the former. But
this dichotomy is a strawman. The urgent question is how
to promote cross-pollination. It becomes prudent for those
committed to these political goals to ask how alliances can
be fostered, rather than leveling critiques based on tactical
differences.
We need compelling stories that dramatize neglected issues,
as media scholar and long-time activist Stephen Duncombe
has argued; he strongly supports the sort of spectacle provided
by Anonymous and so casually dismissed as a juvenile male
fantasy by journalists like Levy.55 Well-funded groups with 
dedicated teams of lawyers, advocates, and policy strategists,
which command the resources for more long-term strategic
and sustainable interventions, are sorely needed. We also
need (well-paid) investigative journalists who dedicate years
to tracking down sources and putting the pieces of difficult
puzzles together. But, as we saw in the Maryville case, these
strategies, when taken alone and lacking a stirred-up pot of
drama, sometimes sadly fail. They simply cannot drum up the
sort of attention or collective will necessary to break ingrained
attitudes and practices. The real problem lies elsewhere: many
people either lack the will or are too cynical to enter the political arena and put up a fight in the first place.
The Sabutage 375
Conclusion: Daybreak
On June 6, 2013, I sat in a frigid New York University
auditorium, waiting for my turn to speak at the
Personal Democracy Forum (PDF), a yearly event
showcasing the Internet’s role in nourishing democratic life.
I felt myself falling into a vortex of negativity. Writing about
those who tunnel and undermine, who desire to be incomprehensible, concealed, and enigmatic (to slightly rephrase
Friedrich Nietzsche’s opening lines in Daybreak), was beginning to seem like an exercise in doom and gloom. Anonymous
was still ruffling feathers with political operations, but Barrett
Brown and Jeremy Hammond, and numerous others, now sat
in prison cells. The Internet had become a giant, sophisticated
tracking machine. Private defense firms, corporations like
Facebook, and American three letter agencies (alongside their
equivalents in other Five Eyes countries) had sunk their claws
in deep: collecting our every trace, predicting our every move.
Even if each organization and country did so for different
purposes and utilized distinct techniques, the net effect was
a troubling and pervasive curtailment of rights. Anonymous,
I was planning to suggest in my talk, had been “the raucous
party at the funeral of online freedom and privacy.”
I was not alone in holding this bleak assessment. As one
Anon, m0rpeth, had put it to me: “We will be small scattered 
378 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
darknets on the fringes of the Internet after all is lost.” Even
the organizers of PDF, normally cheery about the power of
the Internet to tilt the balance of power in favor of freedom
and justice, had admitted at a dinner the evening before that
“things have not turned out as we had hoped.”
And then, right before being called onto the stage, PDF’s
co-organizer, Micah Sifry, suddenly and unexpectedly proffered a lifeline. He leaned over, handed his phone to me, and
whispered, “There has been a major leak about government
surveillance.” I skimmed an article on the phone. Written by
journalist Glenn Greenwald, it divulged the dragnet collection
of metadata phone records by Verizon, on behalf of the NSA.
In a few days, Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who had
provided the information behind the story, would become a
household name. Sifry walked up to the stage to introduce
me. Before he did, he broke the news to the audience, and I
modified my talk on Anonymous to include this hopeful turn
of events.
Snowden’s decision to blow the top off the NSA (and, by
extension, its British counterpart, the GCHQ) was a risky but
carefully plotted act. It substantiated what privacy activists
had been warning about for years, providing them with far
more solid and extensive facts upon which to base their claims.
Laura Poitras, one of the first three journalists to receive the
trove of NSA documents, remarked on the novelty of this situation: “The disclosures made by Snowden have lifted a curtain
and revealed a vast hidden world where decisions are made
and power operates in secret outside of any public oversight or
consent. So my vision hasn’t really changed, but what I’m able
to see has vastly increased.”1
 Here is but a fraction of what we
we can now see thanks to the mega-leak: the NSA spied upon
or directly surveilled thirty-eight embassies and missions; until
2011, the NSA harvested and stored vast swaths of American
emails and metadata under a program called Stellar Wind; the
NSA compelled tech giants to hand over data using FISA court
warrants—while also covertly tapping into fiber-optic cables, 
like those owned by Google, to secretly siphon even more data;
the NSA hacked into Al Jazeera’s internal communications
systems; the GCHQ led a DDoS attack against Anonymous
and hacked Belgacom, a partly state-owned Belgian telecommunications company; and under a program fittingly called
Optic Nerve, the GCHQ intercepted and stored webcam
images from millions of Yahoo! users. And there was more:
a four-month investigation by Barton Gellman and Julie Tate
demonstrated that “ordinary Internet users, American and
non-American alike, far outnumber legally targeted foreigners
in the communications intercepted by the National Security
Agency.”2
Astonishingly, a 2012 NSA report, also included in the
leaks, revealed the spy agency’s dissatisfaction with all of
these accomplishments. The NSA sought to broaden its reach
further by deploying an even more aggressive cyberoffensive
strategy, allowing them to gather data from “anyone, anytime,
anywhere,” as reported by Laura Poitras and James Risen for
the New York Times.
3
Such aggressive and wide-ranging forms of surveillance
preemptively decimate the possibility of a “right to be let
alone,” to use the famous 1890 phrasing of Samuel Warren
and Louis Brandeis, who were among the first to consider the
legal basis of privacy.4
 And the style of surveillance employed
today strikes not only at the personal, exploratory private
sphere deemed valuable in liberal subject formation—it also
preempts many forms of association that are essential to
democratic life. The radical technology collective and Internet
service provider Riseup sums it up well:
What surveillance really is, at its root, is a highly effective form
of social control. The knowledge of always being watched
changes our behavior and stifles dissent. The inability to
associate secretly means there is no longer any possibility
for free association. The inability to whisper means there is
no longer any speech that is truly free of coercion, real or
Conclusion 379
380 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
implied. Most profoundly, pervasive surveillance threatens
to eliminate the most vital element of both democracy and
social movements: the mental space for people to form dissenting and unpopular views.5
Intelligence agencies naturally require some secrecy to function effectively in the public interest. But when secrecy is left
entirely unchecked—especially when granted to those already
afforded extraordinary amounts of power and resources—
it becomes a breeding ground for the sorts of abuse we saw
emerge under J. Edgar Hoover’s helm at the FBI, such as
COINTELPRO.
The surveillance apparatus exposed by Snowden is also
technologically, and thus historically, distinctive. With enough
computer power it becomes frighteningly easy to gather data,
especially through complete automation. And as civil liberties lawyer Jennifer Granick points out, “Once you build the
mousetrap of surveillance infrastructure, they will come for
the data.”6
The state leans with particular force on collected data and
informant reports to actively target niche groups—currently
the US and UK spy disproportionately on Muslims, environmental activists, and, increasingly, hacktivists.7
 This is
the conclusion reached in Mapping Muslims: NYPD Spying
and Its Impact on American Muslims, an investigative report
about NYPD’s tellingly named “Demographics Unit” issued
by a trio of nonprofits.8
 Established by a former CIA official
soon after 9/11, the program proved so controversial and so
ineffective—no actionable intelligence emerged from the collected data—that it was dismantled in April 2014, but only
after disrupting and distorting the social fabric of targeted
Muslim communities for more than a decade.9
 The program
included the use of 15,000 informants and the building of a
large dossier through extensive video and photographic surveillance. A Muslim college student featured in the report,
Sari, captured the invasiveness in a single sentence: “It’s as if 
the law says: the more Muslim you are, the more trouble you
can be, so decrease your Islam.”10 The leaks also confirmed
that the NSA monitors “prominent Muslim-Americans,”
including lawyers, professors, and other professionals even
when they have no links to terrorist or criminal activity. After
three months of investigative research and extensive interviews with five targets, “all vehemently deny any involvement
in terrorism or espionage, and none advocates violent jihad or
is known to have been implicated in any crime, despite years
of intense scrutiny by the government and the press.”11
In the United States, Muslim Americans endure the brunt of
what the ACLU describes as “suspicionless surveillance.”12 But
ubiquitous monitoring has consequences throughout society.
As journalist Laurie Penny has persuasively argued, “If you
live in a surveillance state for long enough, you create a censor
in your head.”13 When video cameras are routine fixtures in
urban landscapes; when corporate Internet giants store records
of online navigation and communication (and make them
frighteningly easy for the NSA to access); and when managers and bosses maintain capabilities to “measure and monitor
employees as never before,” as reporter Steve Lohr has put
it, society at large pays the price.14 These different vectors of
surveillance aggregate, exerting a pressure for us to blend in,
to think twice before speaking out, to, in essence, follow a
narrow set of prescribed norms. Social conformity encourages
quiet resignation and discourages the experimental—and necessarily risky—acts of speaking, thinking, and doing required
for healthy democratic dissent.
Will we, with the help of people like the ex-NSA contractor
who bore enormous risk in speaking out, manage to compel
our governments to curb such abuses and, in so doing, restore
our right to associate free of undue surveillance? The hurdles
are gargantuan; the sanctioned channels for political change
in the United States are frighteningly narrow.15 The technical
architecture of the Internet—wherein centralized, corporatecontrolled servers house most of our data—makes capture both

trivially easy and ubiquitous; this technical scenario has been
described by civil liberties lawyer Eben Moglen as a “recipe
for disaster,” prompting him and other Internet technologists,
like security expert Bruce Schneier, to declare, “We need to
figure out how to re-engineer the internet to prevent this kind
of wholesale spying.”16 Finally, as ACLU staff technologist
Chris Soghoian argues, so long as Internet firms continue to
“monetize their users’ private data,” they can never adopt a
truly “pro-user” privacy policy.17
And yet, a field which had seemed hopelessly desolate now
resembles fertile terrain. The politically engaged geek family
continues to grow—in size and political significance. It is constituted by various organizations and activists working with
politicians, lawyers, journalists, and artists. Many emerged
from the geeky quarters of the Internet. There is Julian Assange,
Birgitta Jónsdóttir, Chelsea Manning, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, Sarah Harrison, the Tor developers, Anonymous,
Riseup, Edward Snowden, and many more. The last two
years have been singular—never before have so many geeks
and hackers wielded their keyboards for the sake of political
expression, dissent, and direct action.18
Increasingly, thanks to their combined actions, we recognize that we stand at a crossroads. Snowden ignited a fiery
national conversation over privacy that has continued for over
a year—a minor miracle in a mass mediascape that lionizes
novelty and eschews long-term, sustained deliberation. There
are promising signs of legislative change. In what free speech
advocate Trevor Timm described as “a surprising rebuke to
the NSA’s lawyers and the White House,” the US House of
Representatives passed a sweeping bill in June 2014 prohibiting warrantless access to Americans’ emails and banning
intelligence agencies from installing back doors in commercial
hardware, with or without vendor complicity.19 The effects of
the leak have in turn reverberated far beyond national borders,
as Glenn Greenwald attests: 
[Snowden’s leak] changed the way people around the world
viewed the reliability of any statements made by US officials
and transformed relations between countries. It radically
altered views about the proper role of journalism in relation to government power. And within the United States, it
gave rise to an ideologically diverse, trans-partisan coalition
pushing for meaningful reform of the surveillance state.20
All this seems even more remarkable when one considers the
viciousness with which many government officials, especially
within the intelligence community, have reacted to Snowden.
One anecdote is emblematic of the attitude: during the
2014 Ottawa Conference on Defense and Security, Melissa
Hathaway, former director of the US Joint Interagency Cyber
Task Force in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
recounted to her audience that she learned of Snowden’s flight
to Russia (to seek political asylum) while in Tel Aviv. “I have
to tell you the Israelis have a point of view that I do too. That
he should have never been allowed to get on that plane—and
then they [the Israelis] took it a little bit further: that the plane
would have never landed.” As the uproarious laughter died
down, Hathaway punctuated the sentiment with a one-liner:
“I still might subscribe to their point of view.”21 Yet, even as
the American state diminishes Snowden by calling him a mere
criminal, his political claims are becoming more salient every
day. Hathaway herself acknowledged this in the statement
that catalyzed the above anecdote. “Our allies feel betrayed.
Their citizens believe that Edward Snowden is a hero.”
Snowden has fueled a nascent movement composed of
technology collectives, lawyers, journalists, filmmakers, politicians, and NGOs of varying stripes. This movement has
lent its voice to the preexisting struggles of groups like the
nonprofits Fight for the Future and the Open Technology
Institute. The result has been a range of targeted policy and
technological campaigns, such as Reset the Net, a grassroots
effort to “to spread NSA-resistant privacy tools” so that they

might become default features of the Internet.22 Technologies
like The Amnesic Incognito Live System (also known as Tails,
an operating system built for anonymity), Open Whisper
Systems (an open-source endeavor to develop encryption software for mobile phones), and LEAP (a recursive acronym for
the LEAP Encryption Access Project, which modifies existing encryption tools to make them user friendly) are being
funded by citizens and organizations like Freedom of the Press
Foundation. Snowden himself has endorsed encryption projects as both effective and necessary: “The bottom line is that
encryption does work,” he told a packed room at South by
Southwest in March 2014.23 These technologies are poised to
facilitate some semblance of privacy for future generations of
Internet users.
Old World vs. New World
Soon after the first batch of NSA revelations, Ireland saw
its first hacking court case. Two members of LulzSec and
Anonymous, Donncha O’Cearbhaill and Darren Martyn,
were tried in July 2013 for the 2011 defacement of the website
of Irish political party Fine Gael. En route to the courthouse
in Dublin, I got lost and ended up arriving late. Because I own
no personal tracking device (or cell phone, as you will), I did
what people have done for centuries: I consulted a paper map
and confused myself. It took me another forty-five minutes
to reach the correct court, housed in a modern circular glass
building. I was sure I had missed the proceedings.
As it turned out, the two cases were sandwiched between
more than a dozen petty criminal hearings; it would be
another hour before O’Cearbhaill and Martyn stood before
the judge. As I waited, sitting next to a local Anon nicknamed
Firefly, we had a grand time watching the judge—a sensible
and matronly woman in her fifties—gently, but firmly, scold
the dozen other defendants. Most of them had been involved 
in youthful mischief and disorderly conduct. In one case, a
twenty-something young lady with stunningly long black hair,
an indignant scowl, crossed arms, and an immodest wardrobe
was found guilty of beating up a member of the Garda—the
local police—while thoroughly inebriated.
The two Anonymous cases clearly stood out from the lineup
of brawls and drunken mischief. After hearing both sides in
two defacement cases, the judge expressed skepticism about
the prosecution’s claim that restoring the Fine Gael website
was expensive. How, she asked, could it possibly have cost ten
thousand euros if nothing was damaged? The prosecution had
no answer. The judge concluded that this hack was a “stunt
to embarrass a political party rather than to disclose data to
the public at large.” She did not want to see O’Cearbhaill and
Martyn go to jail for the digital equivalent of graffiti. Nor did
she think that their acts were laudable. Instead, she admonished both, calling their hack “a terrible abuse of talent.” Then
she fined them each five thousand euros—payable by October
(and with half going to charity)—and ordered them to enroll
in a restorative justice program. She did not see what they
did as political—had she, the humane punishment might have
been even more lenient.
After the case adjourned, O’Cearbhaill and Martyn slipped
out with their families. Firefly and I headed out toward the
center of town, strolling along Dublin’s main canal under the
sun—Ireland was experiencing a miraculous two-week heatwave. Together, we did a postmortem of the trial. We agreed
that O’Cearbhaill and Martyn got off very light; compared to
the Anons tried in the United States, the Irish and British cases
were remarkably mild. While the act of defacing a website
does not compare to Hammond’s actions, the long string of
hacks that Ryan “Kayla” Ackroyd, a British national, carried
out with LulzSec came a bit closer. In May 2013, after he pled
guilty to one charge of hacking the Pentagon and conspiring
to hack Sony, Britain’s National Health Service, and Rupert
Murdoch’s News International, the British state sentenced
Conclusion 385
386 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
Ackroyd to thirty months in jail, of which he served ten;
notably, he received no fine. In the US cases, even when the
prison sentences are relatively short, the fines added on top
virtually guarantee years of indentured servitude. At the age
of twenty-two, John Anthony Borell III, aka Kahuna of the
CabinCr3w, was sentenced to thirty-six months in prison for
hacking into multiple police websites and dumping personal
data. After serving his time, he will then still have to pay nearly
$230,000 in damages.
In addition, many of the charges leveled against hackers
in the United States have seemed to come out of left field,
as illustrated by the ordeal of Barrett Brown. On March
6, 2012, the same day Fox News outed Sabu and the FBI
arrested Hammond, the G-men executed a search warrant
for Barrett Brown’s residence. Among other things, authorities sought to locate “records relating to HBGary, Infragard,
Endgame Systems, Anonymous, LulzSec, IRC Chats, Twitter,
wiki.echelon2.org, and pastebin.com.”24 Six months later, in
September, the FBI arrested Brown (live on video chat, fittingly) after he—to be entirely frank—set himself up for a
raid. He had posted a video online entitled “Why I’m Going
to Destroy FBI Agent Robert Smith Part Three Revenge of the
Lithe,” which featured a hyperbolic tirade against a federal
agent who had questioned his mother.25 As expected, he was
then arrested for threatening an FBI agent. An excerpt from
Brown’s rant might demonstrate more clearly why he was so
full of fury—and why the FBI, in turn, was compelled to raid
him (rather than simply writing the video off as a piece of
performance art):
Guess what’s on my fucking search warrant: fraud! I bring
in no money … a fucking fraud charge for a fucking writer
activist, who has no money, who has spent all his money
on fucking lawyers for himself and his fucking mother …
Agent Smith posted addresses of [my house and my mother’s
house] … He is a criminal, involved in a criminal conspiracy 
… Anyway, that’s why Smith’s life is over. When I say his
life is over, I’m not saying I’m going to go kill him, but I
am going to ruin his life and look into his fucking kids …
How do you like them apples? As Smith has noted, I’m in
danger from the Zetas … Thanks to that fella [for putting
up my address] … I will assume that since the Zetas often
take the guise of Mexican security personnel [and often are]
government officials, I’m concerned that the same trick may
be played here … Particularly the FBI … will be regarded
as potential Zeta assassin squads, and as the FBI [knows]
… they know that I’m armed, that I come from a military
family, that I was taught to shoot by a Vietnam vet … and
I will shoot all of them and kill them if they come and do
anything because they are engaged in a criminal conspiracy
and I have reason to fear for my life not just from the Zetas,
but the US governments [sic] … I have no choice left but to
defend myself, my family … and frankly, you know, it was
pretty obvious I was going to be dead before I was forty,
so I wouldn’t mind going out with two FBI sidearms like a
fucking Egyptian pharaoh. Adios
Alongside charges for these threats, Brown also faced charges
related to the Stratfor hack. In his Project PM chat room, he
had shared a web link to an externally hosted file containing the leaked Stratfor credit card data. For doing so, he was
charged with ten counts of aggravated identify theft and two
counts relating to credit card fraud, with a combined total
possible sentence of forty-five years (plus the sixty-some years
for the other charges). Many other people who had also publicly circulated the link were not charged. Journalist Adrian
Chen, who tended to be critical of Anonymous, wrote: “As
a journalist who covers hackers and has ‘transferred and
posted’ many links to data stolen by hackers—in order to put
them in stories about the hacks—this indictment is frightening
because it seems to criminalize linking.”26
Because Brown was Anonymous’s ethical foil, flaunting
Conclusion 387
388 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
himself as the face of a collective seeking to be faceless, he was
a divisive figure. Nevertheless, Anons concurred with Kevin
Gallagher, the system administrator running Brown’s support
campaign, when he argued that “it was this journalistic work
of digging into areas that powerful people would rather keep
in the dark that made him a target.”27 Brown’s supporters
raised funds, helped secure top-notch lawyers, and worked to
publicize his charges.
In a surprising plot twist, the government dropped the
linking charges just two days after the defense filed its motion
to dismiss. (Dropping the charges avoids bad precedent and
allows the government to continue pursuing investigations of
the same ilk.) Still facing an extraordinary 105 years in prison,
gagged against speaking to the media, and having already
spent over a year and a half in custody, Brown accepted a plea
bargain. At the time of writing, it remains unclear what the
plea bargain will mean for the charges relating to threatening
a federal officer.
The takeaway is this: whether one seeks to hack with
impunity and anonymity—whether politically motivated or
not—or to simply attain the status of a witty and sprightly
rabble-rouser, it is best to do so on the European side of the
Atlantic (where Anonymous and other forms of geek activism
are more common).
Later that evening in Ireland, I was keen to ask O’Cearbhaill
his thoughts about the case, but he was nowhere to be found.
As it turns out, the Garda had been waiting for him outside
of the courthouse, where they again arrested him—not for
hacking this time. O’Cearbhaill, a chemistry student, maintained a laboratory at his parent’s home. Some of the chemicals
could (in theory) be used to make explosives. Although there
was not an iota of evidence that he was using, or intended to
use, the chemicals for such purposes, he was arrested under
Irish antiterrorism legislation.
While the prosecutor later determined that there was
insufficient evidence to bring a case, some Anons floated a 
hypothesis that the Garda was attempting to intimidate
O’Cearbhaill into fessing up to his alleged involvement in
what had become a legendary hack. Back in early February
2012, AntiSec had released audio of an intercepted conference
call among the FBI, Scotland Yard, and the Garda. The subject
of the conference call was none other than Anonymous itself.
The leaked call was not only a 100 percent lulzly hack, but
also an (apparently) lasting embarrassment to the agencies
involved, in particular the Garda. It was the email account of
one of its own officers that had been compromised to obtain
the data needed to “join” the call. (At the time of this writing,
no one has been found guilty of this intrusion).
The case may also suggest another reason why law enforcement is hostile toward computer spelunkers. Hackers
occasionally make it their mission to “watch the watchers.”
Two Kevins—Poulsen and Mitnick—had done it before.
Media scholar Douglas Thomas, who covered the ordeal
of both hackers, noted how “Poulsen hacked into the FBI’s
systems and discovered a maze of wiretaps and surveillance
programs that were monitoring everyone and everything
from the restaurant across the street from him to (allegedly)
Ferdinand Marcos.”28 AntiSec pulled off the same thing, but
even more loudly and publicly.
A few days later, O’Cearbhaill, free again, joined a group of
us for a summer picnic on Saint Stephen’s Green. I had brought
together a range of Anons from different networks and operational iterations, from the ex-Scientologist Pete Griffiths
(a keen Anonymous supporter) to David from Chanology,
Firefly from AnonOps, and hackers like O’Cearbhaill. He
told me more about how he first got into hacktivism at
the age of fifteen, and about his father’s experiences in the
IRA—including the six years he spent in jail and the fortyday hunger strike he carried out. His father, unlike the judge,
had naturally understood his son’s actions as political. By
the summer of 2013, I was confident that most Anonymous
participants were politically inclined; they may tunnel and

undermine, but they do so in an attempt to dig through to
daybreak—to end the dark reign of injustice. Still, something
shifts when a person hears stories like the ones O’Cearbhaill
shared with me. Fleeting shadows and perceptions become
grounded and legible; it becomes so clear that each contributor has a rich life story that has led him or her to Anonymous,
and that Anonymous itself functions as a portal to further
destinations still.
Indeed, a year later I returned to Dublin and, alongside
fifty other audience members, sat in Trinity College’s Science
Gallery and listened to O’Cearbhaill—now the auditor of the
Dublin University Pirate Party—give a talk about Tor, the
privacy tool. We were at a meet-up organized by CryptoParty,
a grassroots movement that aims to teach cryptography to the
general public. The idea was hatched by Asher Wolf and some
other geeks in 2012. Just days later, over beers at a pub in
London, Mustafa Al-Bassam (tflow) told me about his internship at Privacy International, the leading European NGO
fighting for the right to whisper. There are dozens of other
examples. Whatever one may think of Anonymous, it clearly
acted as a political gateway. Many who left the group will
continue, in different ways, to contribute to political life.
Unlike Al-Bassam and many others, Hammond and
Monsegur were activists well before they became involved
in Anonymous. But their paths diverged radically when their
involvement with the collective ended. Soon after news broke
about Monsegur’s cooperation, he vanished—and nobody
had any clue as to where he had gone. As it turns out, he
spent seven months in the Metropolitan Correctional Center,
the same prison where Hammond was incarcerated before he
was moved to Kentucky to serve out his ten-year sentence.
An anonymous source had tipped me off—but my pleas to
reporters for a detailed investigation as to why he was in
prison fell on deaf ears. Only later did I receive confirmation
from Hammond himself. It wasn’t until May 26, 2014, when
Monsegur was finally sentenced after seven delays, that the 
circumstances leading to Monsegur’s rearrest and incarceration were made available to the public. He had violated his
bail conditions by penning a blog post and chatting with an
Anonymous participant. At the sentencing, Judge Loretta
Preska breathlessly trumpeted Monsegur as a model informant and determined that his 2012 stint in jail was punishment
enough. He was a free man. Before he strolled out of court,
Preska further lauded Monsegur: “The immediacy of Mr.
Monsegur’s cooperation and its around-the-clock nature was
particularly helpful to the government … That personal characteristic of turning on a dime to doing good, not evil, is the
most important factor in this sentencing.” Preska’s lenient sentence not-so-subtly relayed the following message to future
informants: cooperate and you will be treated well.
Although the outcome was far from surprising, Twitter was
aflutter with wails of outrage: “Jeremy Hammond is serving
a ten-year sentence for hacks that Sabu (working for the feds)
told him to do. When will the feds go to prison?”29 asked
@YourAnonNews. “Preska is an absolute disgrace to the
concept of justice,” offered Firefly during an interview. These
laments could do nothing to alter Hammond’s situation—but
many Anons derived some measure of comfort when, only
days later, both Motherboard and the Daily Dot published
accounts which called the government storyline into question
—effectively corroborating Hammond’s version of the events.
Along with cooperating “around-the-clock,” the news reports
ascertained that Monsegur was given free rein to initiate,
coordinate, and carry out dozens of hacks.
Following Monsegur’s release, Hammond issued his own
statement: “By aggressively prosecuting hackers who play by
their own rules, they want to deter others from taking up the
cause and hope future arrests will yield more aspiring cooperators. We must continue to reject excuses and justifications
that make it acceptable to sell out your friends and become
a pawn of cyber-imperialism … Sabu avoided a prison sentence, but the consequences of his actions will haunt him

for the rest of his life. Not even halfway through my time, I
would still rather be where I’m at: while they can take away
your freedom temporarily, your honor lasts forever.”30 While
Hammond’s lengthy detention will undoubtedly be trying, his
vocal commitment to his principles in spite of his unmasking
and incarceration have already proved a beacon of inspiration
to many in the activist community.
While it might seem unusual for a researcher to become so
entangled with his or her object of study, it has long been par
for the course in anthropology. As Danilyn Rutherford writes,
anthropological methods “create obligations, obligations that
compel those who seek knowledge to put themselves on the line
by making truth claims that they know will intervene within
the setting and among the people they describe.”31 As part of a
letter-writing campaign organized by Hammond’s lawyers, I,
along with 150 other citizens, wrote to Judge Loretta Preska
to ask for leniency; in the letters, we emphasized the political
nature of Anonymous. Wherever possible, I have attempted
to translate the confusing world of Anonymous for multiple
publics. I have also been writing letters to some of the Anons
in prison. As part of these obligations, I’ve thought long and
deliberately about the underlying goals motivating this book.
Ultimately, I reached the conclusion that I have two clashing objectives: to stamp out misinformation and to embrace
enchantment.
First and foremost, in this book I have sought to dispel
some of the many misconceptions about Anonymous: many
participants like O’Cearbhaill were not primarily driven by a
desire to accrue lulz—even if this irreverent spirit still guided
social interactions and underwrote strategies. Anonymous has
matured into a serious political movement, so much so that
many of the trolls from the “Internet Hate Machine” days
would “not recognize” the Anonymous of today, as Ryan
Ackroyd told me. He is among the tiny fraction of participants
who bridged the divide between these now clearly distinctive 
eras. (Of course this does not mean that the Machine of
Hate won’t rise again, as an Anonymous activist named
“blackplans” tweeted: “Without the trolls, the hackers, the
4chan hordes, how many of you nice, sensitive people would
ever have heard of #Anonymous? Remember.”)32
As part of this first mission, I’ve sought to avoid extolling
Anonymous’s every move. Even in its activist incarnations,
Anonymous has clearly engaged in morally dubious—and
sometimes downright awful—endeavors. The most troubling
moments come when innocent people are caught up in the
Anonymous cross fire. Some hacks struck me as counterproductive, and not always worth the risks taken by the persons
involved. Indeed, parts of Anonymous are riddled with irresolvable contradictions.
And so, when assessing Anonymous, it seems impossible
to arrive at a universal—much less neat-and-tidy—maxim
regarding the group’s effects. Instead, I have tried to relay the
lessons of Anonymous by narrating its exploits, failures, and
successes. These compiled stories are idiosyncratic and told
from the vantage point of my personal travels and travails.
There are so many untold and secret tales that, were they publicized, would likely shift our comprehension of Anonymous.
While all social life and political movements are complex,
even convoluted, displaying endless facets and dimensions,
Anonymous’s embrace of multiplicity, secrecy, and deception
makes it especially difficult to study and comprehend.
This dynamism and multitudinous quality is also one of
Anonymous’s core strengths. Anonymous is emblematic of
a particular geography of resistance. Composed of multiple
competing groups, short-term power is achievable for brief
durations, while long-term dominance by any single group or
person is virtually impossible. In such a dynamic landscape, it
may be “easy to co-opt, but impossible to keep co-opted,” as
Quinn Norton thoughtfully put it during a South by Southwest
panel in March 2013. In this way, the multitudinal “nature”
of Anonymous precludes its subjection to either aspirational
Conclusion 393
394 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
figures working internally, or external figures who would exert
influence either through informants, like Sabu, or through
exogenous pressure. Anonymous is cryptic, forcing us to work
and dance with the scraps and shards it shows us.
That is to say, Anonymous leaves a lot to the imagination.
But not everything; it is vital to understand how Anonymous
underwent a metamorphosis from underworld trolls into
public-facing activists, especially given that nation-states,
prosecutors, government officials, and judges would like to
cast them all as mere criminals. These powers-that-be are
unwilling to acknowledge Anonymous’s actions as driven by
an activist calling; indeed, it may be the potency and the politically motivated character of the group’s actions that prompts
the state to so swiftly criminalize them.33
And so, while I have aimed to blot out misconceptions, the
prospect of fully stripping away the aura of mystery and magic
felt somehow unacceptable (were it even possible). Philosopher
Jane Bennett urges us “to resist the story of the disenchantment of modernity,” and to instead “enhance enchantment.”34
This has been my second aim in collecting riveting tales
about Anonymous. This deliberate elevation of enchantment,
Bennett argues, is a meaningful political gesture, and one that
I am driven to make—for reasons that will become more clear
in these last pages.
Given this second goal, it was only natural for me to adopt
a mythic frame and invite the trickster along for the ride. The
figures in this book embody the contradictions and paradoxes
of life, many of which are irresolvable. By telling these characters’ stories, lessons emerge, not through dry edicts but,
instead, through fascinating, often audacious, tales of exploits.
Trickster lore may be patently mythic, but it bears remembering that, at one point, it was spun by human hands. My role
has been to nudge forward this process of historical and political myth-making—already evident in the routine functioning
of an entity constituted by adept artists, contemporary mythmakers, and concocters of illusion.
Now that we have nearly reached the end of this journey
and I have unveiled the objectives guiding my book, it is left
to you to judge whether I have displayed the cunning requisite to balance the Apollonian forces of empiricism and logic
with the Dionysian forces of enchantment. Whatever your
conclusion, please permit me the license to weave some final
thoughts through and along the gaps which still remain, and
on top of other areas already thick with embroidery. While
Anonymous still leaves me frequently bewildered, there are a
string of inspiring messages we can glean in its wake.
Anonymous Everywhere
Though it is shifty, and though its organizing structures can
never quite be apprehended, Anonymous is composed of people
who decide together and separately to take a stand. Who might
these people be? A neighbor? A daughter? A secretary? A janitor?
A student? A Buddhist? An incognito banker? You? Whatever
sort of people are involved today, one thing is certain: what
began as a network of trolls has become a wellspring of online
insurgency. What started as a narrow reaction to the Church
of Scientology now encompasses a global selection of political causes, from fights against censorship in Tunisia, through
salvos against North American rape culture, on to condemnations of economic and political injustices in Zuccotti Park and
Tahir Square.
Despite an unpredictable—not to mention irreverent and
often destructive—attitude toward the law, Anonymous also
offers an object lesson in what Frankfurt School philosopher
Ernst Bloch calls “the principle of hope.” Bloch, having fled Nazi
Germany, wrote a three-volume tract on the topic while exiled
in the United States. Striving for an “encylopedic” accounting,
he unearthed a stunningly diverse number of signs, symbols,
and artifacts that channeled hope in different historical eras.
The examples gathered range from personal daydreams to
Conclusion 395

time-honoured fairy tales, from the love of music and sports
to mystical or philosophical tracts—anything that might spark
or communicate a glimmer of hope. Working in the shadow
of an overly pessimistic strain of Marxist critique, his opus
reminds us that a better world—or at least the understanding of what that world could be—is in our midst. As a sort of
philosophical archaeologist, Bloch excavated hidden or forgotten messages of utopia, that they might combat “anxiety”
and “fear” in all who encountered them. “The emotion of
hope goes out of itself, makes people broad instead of confining them,” writes Bloch. “The work of this emotion requires
people who throw themselves actively into what is becoming,
to which they themselves belong.”35 That a robust activist politics emerged from the depths of one of the seediest places on
the Internet—that geeks chose to throw themselves actively
into a process of political becoming—strikes me as a perfect
enactment of just such a principle of hope.
Bloch indicted “fraudulent hope,”36 characterized by blind
or overt optimism, for its failure to catalyze movement. Instead,
his hope is a restless one, sustained by passion, wonder, and
even mischief—all qualities embraced by Anonymous. We can
see, then, a strong positivity inherent in Anonymous—a striving toward a realistic form of hope that, once manifest, seems
suited to impel disruption and change. Of course, these activists hold no monopoly over such affective states of passion and
hope. Nevertheless, with the exception of a narrow band of
important thinkers like Chantal Mouffe and Jacques Rancière,
the emotional character of political life is often relegated to
the sidelines—odd, because desire and pleasure are so central
to its very being. But there are other reasons, more urgent than
simply undoing the omission of such a primary component of
activist endeavors, to convey the emotional factors that play
an integral role in social change.
In 2008, when the fearsome, Loki-esque band of trolls that
then constituted Anonymous took that decisive left turn away
from “ultracoordinated motherfuckery” and toward activism, 
they in essence conquered one of the prevailing sentiments of
our times. Media scholar Whitney Phillips convincingly argues
that a widespread cynicism pervades our moment—and that
in trolls we find one of the most distilled, concentrated, and
grotesque extremes of an emotionally dissociative (or politically fetishistic) subculture.37
Many theorists and writers from radically distinct traditions, stretching from the American novelist David Foster
Wallace to Italian autonomist Franco “Bifo” Berardi, have
persuasively argued that cynicism has become a prism through
which large swaths of North Americans and Europeans filter
and feel the world. Wallace writes about the pervasiveness of
“passive unease and cynicism,” and calls for “anti-rebels, born
oglers” to rise up and “and dare somehow to back away from
ironic watching.”38 Bifo, who has written multiple tracts on
the topic, turned to poetry to convey the frightening, dead
emotional burden of cynicism:
Before the tsunami hits, you know how it is?
The sea recedes, leaving a dead desert in which only
cynicism and dejection remain.
All you need to do, is to make sure you have the right
words to say, the right
clothes to wear, before it finally wipes you away.39
Feelings of dejection are not merely figurative shackles. Even
when citizens are aware of the forces that fleece the majority, cynicism can disable political change. When this stance
becomes prevalent enough, it settles into the sinews of society,
further entrenching atomization, preventing social solidarity,
and sharply limiting political possibilities.40 Add anxiety to
the mix, and the resulting cocktail becomes the most lethal of
poisons. The UK-based radical collective Plan C has penned
a perceptive tract entitled “We Are All Very Anxious Now.”
It connects the dots between dire economic conditions, precarious labor, preemptive crackdowns against activists, a

cultural emphasis on self-promotion, and an overpowering
technical state of surveillance: “One major part of the social
underpinning of anxiety is the multifaceted omnipresent
web of surveillance … But this obvious web is only the outer
carapace,” they write. “Ostensibly voluntary self-exposure,
through social media, visible consumption and choice of positions within the field of opinions, also assumes a performance
in the field of the perpetual gaze of virtual others.”41 When this
push toward the panopticon is stacked with a litany of broader
issues—from growing wealth inequality, waves of global and
national recession and unrest, and the looming prospect of
climate-induced environmental disaster—it is not difficult to
understand how a disabling, pervasive, and frightening uncertainty has come to colonize our states of being.
Cynicism and anxiety may be prevalent, but they are neither
omnipotent nor omnipresent; they run up against friction and
resistance—every single day. Untold numbers of activists,
immigrants, displaced people, refugees, various unknowns,
artists, and, remarkably, even some politicians, are all fighting against oppression and pushing against the emotional
onslaught that can so easily lead to such existential traps. If we
are not careful, we might paint too bleak a picture and reify
the very cynicism and anxiety we seek to dismantle. Bloch
insisted that we contribute to a living archive of hope, that we
take care to listen to and take hold of “something other than
the putridly stifling, hollowly nihilistic death-knell.”42
When we consider that the members of Anonymous know
such conditions well, it is either less remarkable, or more
remarkable, that they were able to add to this “living archive
of hope.” I am unable to decide whether Anonymous attracts
those with dark, emotional lives, or whether the pseudonymous environment creates a safe space for sharing what are
simply universal facets of the human condition. Likely it is
some combination of the two. I nevertheless was struck time
and again by this pairing of personal pain with the ardent
desire for its overcoming. 
By sacrificing the public self, by shunning leaders, and
especially by refusing to play the game of self-promotion,
Anonymous ensures mystery; this in itself is a radical political act, given a social order based on ubiquitous monitoring
and the celebration of runaway individualism and selfishness.
Anonymous’s iconography—masks and headless suits—visually
displays the importance of opacity. The collective may not be
the hive it often purports and is purported to be—and it may
be marked by internal strife—but Anonymous still manages to
leave us with a striking vision of solidarity—e pluribus unum.
“A small fire demands constant tending. A bonfire can be
let alone. A conflagration spreads”—so said Anonymous
activist papersplx. By embracing the mask, which sociologist Richard Sennett rightly notes is “one of culture’s oldest
stage props connecting stage and street,” Anonymous took
the dynamics of theatrical trickery and transferred them from
the Internet to the everyday life of resistance.43 Anonymous
became a generalized symbol for dissent, a medium to channel
deep disenchantment with a dictator, with a law, with the
economy, with the culture of rape—basically, with anything.
Anonymous, always the risk-taker, liked to play with fire—
and many participants despised or shunned safety measures;
it is not surprising that the group itself, as a whole, eventually
caught fire, blazing a path for others. Some got burned—both
participants and targets alike. Or as Firefly put it in the film
We Are Legion: “It’s like a phoenix. It might occasionally catch
fire and burn to the ground but it’ll just be reborn from the
ashes. It’ll be reborn stronger.” Pushing hard against rules and
boundaries may often lead to entrapment or demise, but the
entity’s core animating idea—Anonymous if free for anyone
to embody—positions it well for resurrection and reinvention.
Anonymous has appeared many times like a vision, confounding us as we watch the bright flashes of its delightful
(and offensive and confusing) dreams. It is this quality of straddling, on the one hand, mythic space, and on the other, the
reality of activists taking risks and taking action, that makes

the group so enticing. Taken at a distance, it’s like observing
the northern lights, a quiet but mythic battle of gods and tricksters in the night sky, a sky all the more enchanting because
it is everyone’s to watch. The power of Anonymous’s eponymous anonymity is that we are all free to choose whether or
not to don the mask.

Even if a single concept is destined to fail at adequately
conveying the vast and intricate geography fabricated
 by Anonymous activists, in writing this book I found
myself consistently returning to one particular governing
trope: the maze. Every attempt to traverse, understand, or
describe a given state necessarily corrupted it, adding further
entropic inputs which ensured a different experience for any
who would participate within it or even simply watch. So, as
it turns out, researching and writing about Anonymous was
a thrilling but taxing enterprise. I spent years collecting too
much material, attempting to build my own labyrinth that
would allow me to chart a course through theirs. But when I
set out to unravel the tangled threads, to find my way out of
the collected stories, rumors, conversations, and secrets into
some coherent and lucid narrative, I realized in horror that the
gossamer material was disintegrating in my hands. I was lost
in the nether regions between mazes, with no bearings and
no way out. Thankfully, a host of friends, colleagues, strangers, and Anons helped me find my way, nudging me along on
my journey and contributing to its ultimate manifestation as
a book.
This project was long in the making. Its beginnings can be
traced to a Killam Postdoctoral Research Fellowship I held at 
402 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
the University of Alberta in 2006–7, and a fortunate introduction to Dr. Stephen A. Kent, who, in his work as professor
of sociology, curates the largest academic Scientology archive
in the world. In the midst of a frighteningly frigid winter, I
dove into the archive with hopes of emerging with a short
historical side project describing a case known among geeks
as “Scientology vs. the Internet.” Being more accustomed to
interviewing people than making sense of heaps of (in this
case, very strange) documents, Kent thankfully and graciously
walked me through the confusing, fascinating, and at times
disturbing innards of an organization so many geeks love to
loathe.
In January 2008, my historical project leaped into the present
when, in the course of targeting the Church of Scientology,
Anonymous underwent a broader and surprising metamorphosis from fearsome pranksters to fervent protesters. I was
hooked. It seemed only natural to follow these mad hatters
and see if anything would come of their bold and unexpected
foray into protest culture—and clearly something did. By
that time I had relocated to New York City and discovered
a physical portal into Anonymous through the rambunctious
local cell that welcomed me to its monthly protests. In turn,
I welcomed members of the cell into my classroom, where
my students and I benefited from both their eloquent lectures
on the political significance of Anonymous and their theatrical antics demonstrating the lulz. Little Sister, Sethdood, and
Matthew “PokeAnon” Danziger met with me on numerous
occasions and proved lively interlocutors. The latter two even
sat for formal interviews. I also experienced the delight of close
acquaintance with Chanology Dublin and other Irish Anons;
they were some of my most intrepid teachers. I crossed the
ocean to draw upon this valuable resource on numerous occasions, and by my third trip in a three-year span, it was clear
that a few of them, notably Pete, David, Firefly, and Donncha,
had become more than sources—they had become friends. I
look forward to future exchanges.
In 2010, when Anonymous broke into public consciousness
with its direct-action digital campaign protesting the banking
blockade leveled against WikiLeaks, I was fortuitously on
sabbatical at a sanctuary—the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton. The punishing pace of activity that subsequently cascaded from the AnonOps network would have
been nearly impossible to follow were it not for the glut of
time I was afforded. Conversations with two colleagues in
my cohort, Manu Goswami and Tanya Erzen, helped shape
my thinking on the topic. Anthropologist Didier Fassin
proved an inspirational mentor, whose boundless willingness
to share feedback was confirmed again after I presented on
Anonymous at a recent workshop on public ethnography
held at the IAS.
As 2010 turned into 2011, I lost myself full time in the
ever-shifting maze of Anonymous. At times ambling with no
direction or purpose, and at other times ardently driven to
fulfill a mission, I spoke with dozens upon dozens of participants, benefiting from their time, experiences, insights, and
critiques. I thank every one of you and I am sorry for my
inability to remember and list all of your names—whether
real, fake, or pseudonymous. A few folks necessitate special
mention, going beyond the call of duty in their willingness to
guide me. Early on, Trivette, meddle, and n0pants each spoke to
me one-on-one and opened various doors in so doing. I found
welcome homes in #reporter, #freedommods, and eventually
#cabincr3w, where conversations ran into the hours and were
always lively and illuminating. Over time, a handful of other
folks put me on different paths of thinking. Anonymous9—
teeming with energy—was inexhaustibly helpful. This book,
at least in this form, would simply not be possible without
him. m0rpeth was probably the first of a handful of insiders
to implore me to stop drinking the Kool-Aid; his trenchant
critiques of emergent power structures made it easier for me
to intuit them and, in so doing, apprehend the many strains
of internal critique existent in Anonymous. blackplans, a

consistent presence spanning different eras and scenes, was
boundlessly erudite and witty about Anonymous and hackers
(not to mention life in general). Andrew Auerhenheimer, certainly far from being anonymous, or a fan of Anonymous,
taught me a lot about trolling, often through his trollish arguments and statements, but thankfully never trolled me. Many
others spent quite a bit of time chatting with me, including
c0s, AnonyOps, Barrett Brown, evilworks, q, mr_a, sharpie,
kantanon, shitstorm, owen, Avunit, emmi, Jackal, p0ke,
crypt0anonymous, Nicole Powers, Nixie, Commander X,
JMC, papersplx, Lauri Love, and others who will remain
anonymous.
Over time (and due to a string of arrests), the circumstances
of my research changed in equal measure with the public perception of its subjects. Many Anons have endured difficult
legal battles and time in prison. Given just how complicated
their lives became, I am all the more grateful that they made
time for me. The book could simply not have been completed
without the generosity and the acumen of Jeremy Hammond,
Mustafa Al-Bassam, Donncha O’Cearbhaill, Darren Martyn,
and Mercedes Haefer, each of whom poured hours into
answering endless strings of sometimes repetitive questions.
Chris Weatherhead and Jake Davis also met with me in person
to share many of their experiences; Ryan Ackroyd, who I only
started to interact with recently, commented thoughtfully on
the “Internet Hate Machine” and informants.
During research I could be found chatting with a number of
journalists and filmmakers who, like me, spent an enormous
about of time toiling away trying to crack the Anonymous
puzzle. Their presence was welcome—talking shop and trading
some research notes proved to be both comically relieving and
professionally invaluable. Conversations with Quinn Norton,
Asher Wolf, Steve Ragan, and Brian Knappenberger were
instrumental to my thinking on Anonymous. Steve Ragan also
deserves special mention for sharing so freely—most journalists
are far more guarded about their possessions. Knappenberger’s 
film and Parmy Olson’s engrossing account of Anonymous and
LulzSec proved to be valuable resources for this project.
In 2013, a slew of colleagues read a couple of early chapters and dispensed thoughtful commentary: Danielle Citron,
Nathan Schneider, Jonathan Sterne, Darin Barney, Christine
Ross, Carrie Rentschler, Sandra Hyde, Michael Ralph,
Whitney Phillips, and Chris Kelty. Over the years, I have lectured extensively on Anonymous, and it would be impossible
to take stock of all the bountiful feedback I received; however,
comments from Paul Eiss, Angela Zito, Faye Ginsburg, Haidy
Geismar, Daniel Miller, Alberto Sanchez, and Bob Rutledge
are of particular note.
At McGill University, I am fortunate to hold a position
designed to enable my engagement in both outreach and
writing; I am deeply grateful to the generous donor who
provides its funding. The environment at McGill has proved
stimulating, and I am especially thankful to all the Bits, Bots
and Bytes participants for contributing to a research forum
and scholarly exchange that has become one of the highlights
of my month. Two of its members, Scott Kushner and Elena
Razlogova, read and commented incisively on additional
material shared outside of the meet-up. My undergraduate
student and unflagging research assistant Maya Richmond
has successfully hunted down every last bit of material I asked
her to procure while also providing sharp insights regarding
hackers and tricksters. Caroline Habluetzel, who received
a PhD from our department, also provided invaluable and
meticulous research assistance, all while battling cancer. She
passed away in May 2013 and will be missed. My graduate class, “Technological Underworlds,” was given an early
draft of the first five chapters to read, resulting in fascinating
questions and the identification of various problems. Darcie
DeAngelo went beyond the call of duty to provide extensive
commentary. Molly Sauter was completing her own book—
The Coming Swarm: DDOS Actions, Hacktivism, and Civil
Disobedience on the Internet—throughout the same period,

and reading the manuscript proved both essential and fascinating as I worked through the ethics of digital direct action.
Writing a book for a popular audience while remaining
faithful to complex, esoteric, technical, and legal details is a
formidable challenge. I sought the advice of a host of experts
to ensure that I was not misrepresenting these nuances.
Orin Kerr, Marcia Hoffman, Ahmed Ghappour, and Andres
Guadamuz read through the legal sections. Many technologists
and hackers always delivered answers to my many questions: David Mirza, Chris Soghoian, Dino A. Dai Zovi, Chris
Wysopal, Space Rouge, James Atkinson, Patrick Gray, Dan
Guido, Morgan Marquis-Boire, and Brian Martin. Meanwhile,
journalists Kim Zetter and Ted Bridis clarified some uncertainties I held about hackers and FBI policies toward informants.
Any inaccuracies that remain stem from my inability to follow
the excellent guidance of these consultants.
Family members should be thanked for enduring the negative consequences of book writing—and the Andersons were
patient and gracious as the last three holiday seasons saw me
not quite as present as everyone else. My father, an unflagging supporter of my work, ensured that his friends, most of
them retired, learned something important about Anonymous.
My dog Roscoe, with his cute snaggletooth, was daily able to
woo me from my desk, ensuring that I took necessary breaks
from writing.
Finally, there are three people whose imprint is everywhere
in this book and who have read it start to finish, two of them
more than once. My partner Micah Anderson, who spends
his days (and too often nights) running a privacy-friendly ISP,
is a talented writer. He read the first few chapters, took me
aside, and clued me in to the fact that I needed to be far more
lively and descriptive if this was to be a nonacademic/popular
book. His subsequent readings of every chapter always generated useful comments or edits. He certainly doused with
gasoline all my attempts at humor, before throwing a match
and fueling the fire with jokes of his own. Some were just 
too wild and imaginative and I had to stamp the fire out, but
in the aftermath, things were typically much improved. I am
extremely thankful that he is willing to be part of the creative
process, and that he put up with me as I wrote two books
back to back—something I will never, ever do again.
In part because of Micah’s advice—and in part due to my
own proclivity to explain everything—I went completely overboard with writing. Two people were poised to contain me,
call out my inconsistencies, help me whittle the manuscript
down to an appropriate size, and generally do everything in
their power to make this a better book.
First, my research assistant Matt Goerzen, who is also my
MA student and a quirky and talented artist specializing in,
among other topics, anonymity, was a first line editor. Trained
as a journalist, he is also a dexterous writer gifted in adding
a touch of grace and clarity to any prose that comes his way.
Since he has deeply pondered and completed so much research
on the cultures of online anonymity, his comments were sharp
and discerning. This book is much stronger because of his
unstinting willingness to impart his wisdom. I will be forever
grateful that he took on the role of my most trusted guide and
interlocutor, and I only hope I can return the debt as his MA
thesis supervisor.
When entertaining possible publishers, I wanted one that
would help me reach the right balance between analysis and
accessibility; Verso immediately presented itself as the numberone candidate and it has been a pleasure working with the entire
team, including Mark Martin, Colin Beckett, Jennifer Tighe,
and Jacob Stevens. I am especially grateful to have worked
with Andrew Hsiao. When my book ballooned to an unacceptable size, I will confess that I dreaded the stringent measures
he might enact to trim the manuscript. As I feared the worst,
his advice ultimately proved both stellar and specific, making
the pruning process far less painful than could have been. He
went through the manuscript with a fine-tooth comb; he was
persnickety about the small details of phrasing, he entertained

the value of my arguments, and he zoomed out to identify
the sections, sentences, and even chapters where shaving and
cutting were necessary. There were moments when, if it were
possible to hug someone through email, I would have hugged
him, multiple times. I have also thoroughly enjoyed our conversations about publishing and politics and look forward to
many more in the future.
Finally, I would like to thank all of the masked activists and
pranksters for staging this wildly epic play and giving me the
opportunity to write about it.
A Note on Sources
I
n presenting a popular ethnography of Anonymous, this
book leans heavily on journalistic convention and sourcing
methodologies. Many readers will wonder how the information contained herein can be verified, given that lies, guile,
and fabrication are the tools of the trade—often wielded with
pride—by those operating under the mantle of Anonymous.
But while some of the anecdotes recorded remain unverifiable, or simply accompanied by chat logs, they complement
a factual narrative largely made possible by legal records.
Indeed, this book could not have been written were it not for
the unmasking of many participants upon their arrest and
prosecution—and the troves of careful (and sometimes problematic) information made public by law enforcement toward
this end. Additionally, while anonymity by nature enables
individuals to speak out against and challenge powerful institutions, upon capture and sentencing many participants are
suddenly afforded a different sort of freedom: the ability to
speak honestly about their personal identities and experiences
as individuals, distanced from a collective or protective pseudonym. Access to chat logs and especially court documents
has further enabled me to authenticate many claims made by
Anons and their colleagues prior to arrest (in the great majority of instances what I had been told turned out to be true). 
410 hacker, hoaxer, whistleblower, spy
The extensive chat logs cited in the book come from numerous sources: from public IRC channels, from published logs
put online by Anonymous, from private logs given to me, and
finally from logs submitted as court evidence and leaked to
reporters. In instances where no documents existed, I have
attempted to interview multiple participants and relied, where
possible, on accounts published by respected media figures. It
is a sad reality that many fascinating tales and participants,
unable to be substantiated beyond rumor, were not included
in these pages. Since many of the figures covered in this book
are now well known to the public—and have been written
about extensively—I have not changed their names or their
pseudonyms, except in instances where doing so might pose a
threat to the individual in question.
This book should be read as a collection of personal experiences and reflections. While I address major events and
historical turning points, and attempt to be inclusive of multiple (even, at times, conflicting) perspectives, there is much
more at work within Anonymous than what is in these pages.

9. Since the FD-302 provides a summary of an interview instead of a
transcript, activists and lawyers have long criticized it for its bias. Civil
liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglate encapsulated its problems in an
op-ed: “Frightened and confused interviewees, who, if they deny they
said what any 302 report claims they uttered, can then be indicted for
making false statements” (Silvergate, “Unrecorded Testimony,” bostonglobe.com, May 11, 2013). In May 2014, the FBI reversed its policy
and will now mandate recording for most interviews with federal suspects. (Andrew Grossman, “FBI to Record Most Interrogations of
Suspects in Federal Custody,”online.wsj.com, May 21, 2014.)

40. Of course, due to the enormous plurality exhibited in contemporary
industrial societies, it is naive and dangerous to boil something as
complex as political sentiments to single “structures of feeling,” to
borrow Raymond Williams’s useful phrase. It would be equally naive
to entirely discard an analysis of dominant trends—whether economic
or affective—such as the turn to cyncism. Raymond Williams, Marxism

On the Typeface
This book is set in Sabon, a narrow Garamond-style book face
designed in 1968 by the German typographer Jan Tschichold.
Tschichold had been a leading voice of sans-serif modernist
typography, particularly after the publication of his Die neue
Typographie in 1928. As a result, the Nazis charged him with
“cultural Bolshevism” and forced him to flee Germany for
Switzerland.
Tschichold soon renounced modernism—comparing its
stringent tenets to the “teachings of National Socialism and
fascism”—and extolled the qualities of classical typography,
exemplified in his design for Sabon, which he based on the
Romain S. Augustin de Garamond in the 1592 EgenolffBerner specimen sheet.
Sabon is named after the sixteenth-century French typefounder Jacques Sabon, a pupil of Claude Garamond and
proprietor of the Egenolff foundry.

    ABSTRACT
    As thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, to protest the fatal police shooting of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown in the summer of 2014, news and commentary on the shooting, the protests, and the militarized response that followed circulated widely through social media networks. Through a theorization of hashtag usage, we discuss how and why social media platforms have become powerful sites for documenting and challenging episodes of police brutality and the misrepresentation of racialized bodies in mainstream media. We show how engaging in “hashtag activism” can forge a shared political temporality, and, additionally, we examine how social media platforms can provide strategic outlets for contesting and reimagining the materiality of racialized bodies. Our analysis combines approaches from linguistic anthropology and social movements research to investigate the semiotics of digital protest and to interrogate both the possibilities and the pitfalls of engaging in “hashtag ethnography.”

Our analysiscombines approaches from linguistic anthropologyand social movements research to investigate thesemiotics of digital protest and to interrogate boththe possibilities and the pitfalls of engaging in“hashtag ethnography.” [digital anthropology, digitalactivism, social movements, social media, semiotics,race, Twitter, Michael Brown, United States]On Saturday, August 9, 2014, at 12:03 p.m., an unarmed blackteenager named Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police offi-cer in Ferguson, Missouri, a small town on the outskirts of St.Louis. Within the hour, a post appeared on the Twitter socialmedia platform stating, “I just saw someone die,” followed bya photograph taken from behind the beams of a small wooden balconyoverlooking Canfield Drive, where Michael Brown’s lifeless body lay uncov-ered, hands alongside his head, face down on the asphalt.1Immediatelyfollowing the incident, community members assembled to demand an ex-planation for why this unarmed 18-year-old had been seemingly executedwhile reportedly holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender, plead-ing “don’t shoot.” The impromptu gathering soon turned into a sustainedprotest marked by daily demonstrations and violent confrontations withhighly armed local police—all of which were documented in detail acrosssocial media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vine.Occurring on the heels of other highly publicized killings of unarmedblack men—such as Eric Garner (who died as a result of an illegal choke-hold by New York City police just weeks before the events in Ferguson), Os-car Grant (whose death was emotionally portrayed in the award-winningfilmFruitvale Stationreleased just one year prior), and 17-year-old TrayvonMartin (whose 2012 killing sparked national outcry and spurred numer-ous forms of activism)—the death of Michael Brown quickly capturedthe imagination of thousands across and beyond the United States.2Protestors from around the nation flocked to Ferguson to participate indemonstrations calling for the arrest of the officer responsible for the fa-tal shooting. Television viewers tuned in across the country to watch livenews coverage of the violent confrontations between the protestors andthe highly armed local police. Images of these confrontations circulatedwidely in national and international news coverage, and news of theseevents quickly went “viral” across social media. During the initial weekof protests, over 3.6 million posts appeared on Twitter documenting andreflecting on the emerging details surrounding Michael Brown’s death;AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 4–17, ISSN 0094-0496, onlineISSN 1548-1425.C©2015 by the American Anthropological Association.

#FergusonAmerican Ethnologistby the end of the month, “#Ferguson” had appeared morethan eight million times on the Twitter platform.These statements are simple facts, but the meaning andconsequences of these facts will be occupying social ana-lysts for years to come. Much will be written about MichaelBrown: about his portrayal in the media, his treatment bythe police, and both the circumstances and consequencesof his death. Much will also be written about the protestorswho immediately gathered at the site of his killing andabout those who remained, under intense police harass-ment, long after the media spotlight faded.3Butwhatarewe to make of the eight million tweets? What do they tellus about this event, its place in the social imagination, andabout social media itself as a site of both political activismand social analysis?In 1991, a homemade VHS tape of Los Angeles res-ident Rodney King being brutally beaten by four policeofficers sparked outrage across the country and galvanizedthousands in what is widely recognized as one of the mostinfluential examples of citizen journalism in the UnitedStates (Allan and Thorsen 2009).4Today, 56 percent of theU.S. population carries video-enabled smartphones, andthe use of mobile technology is particularly high amongAfrican Americans.5The increased use and availabilityof these technologies has provided marginalized andracialized populations with new tools for documentingincidents of state-sanctioned violence and contesting me-dia representations of racialized bodies and marginalizedcommunities. In many cases—such as police officers’ useof a chokehold in the murder of Eric Garner—the use ofmobile technology to record and circulate footage of eventshas played a key role in prompting public outcry.6In thecase of Ferguson, video footage of the fatal shooting ofMichael Brown has yet to surface, but informal journalismwas used to document the scene in the direct aftermathof his murder, to publicize the protests that ensued, andto bring attention to the militarized police confrontationsthat followed.7Through social media, users were able todisseminate these accounts to a broad audience and toforge new mediatized publics that demand anthropologicalattention. In this essay, we explore how and why platformslike Twitter have become important sites for activismaround issues of racial inequality, state violence, andmedia representations. We examine the possibilities, thestakes, and the necessity of taking these forms of activismseriously while remaining attentive to the limits and pos-sible pitfalls of engaging in what we describe as “hashtagethnography.”Can a hashtag become a field site?In thinking critically about social media as a site of analy-sis, the first question to ask, for anthropologists in partic-ular, is what kind of field site does a platform like Twitterrepresent?8Is Twitter the ultimate “non-place” (Aug ́e 2009)of super modernity, a transient site of fleeting engagement,or is it an instance of a “virtual world” (Boellstorff 2008),with its own set of socialities and forms of engagement? Andis the study of an event through social media a return toa previous era of “armchair anthropology”? Or is hashtagethnography the next logical step in an anthropology of the21st century, one that has become increasingly concernedwith the ontological implications of digital practices (Horstand Miller 2012)?To answer these questions, it is necessary to beginby distinguishing the town of Ferguson, Missouri, from“hashtag Ferguson” and to recognize how each of these con-tributed to the formation of the larger “event” of Ferguson.As those familiar with Twitter know, the hashtag symbol(#) is often used as a way of marking a conversation withinthis platform. The hasthtag serves as an indexing systemin both the clerical sense and the semiotic sense. In theclerical sense, it allows the ordering and quick retrieval ofinformation about a specific topic. For example, in the caseof Ferguson, as details were emerging about the protestsforming at the site of Michael Brown’s death, users begantweeting out information with the hashtag #Ferguson. Thehashtag in this case provided a quick retrieval system forsomeone looking for updated news on the unfolding events.But, in addition to providing a filing system, hashtags simul-taneously function semiotically by marking the intendedsignificance of an utterance. Similar to the coding systemsemployed by anthropologists, hashtags allow users to notsimply “file” their comments but to performatively framewhat these comments are “really about,” thereby enablingusers to indicate a meaning that might not be otherwise ap-parent. Hence, someone could write, “Decades of racial ten-sion and increasing suburban poverty boiled to the surfacelast night” followed by the text “#Ferguson,” as a way of cre-ating a particular interpretive frame. Hashtags thus operatein ways similar to library call numbers: They locate textswithin a specific conversation, allowing for their quick re-trieval, while also marking texts as being “about” a specifictopic.9In addition, hashtags have the intertextual potential tolink a broad range of tweets on a given topic or disparatetopics as part of an intertextual chain, regardless of whether,from a given perspective, these tweets have anything to dowith one another. Thus, a tweet in support of Fergusonprotestors and a tweet in support of Officer Darren Wilsoncould both be coded and filed under #Ferguson. Moreover,a tweet about racial disparity in Missouri, such as “racismlives here,” and one about a night out on the town in St.Louis could both be marked #STL.This insight requires anthropologists to carefully con-sider the variety of uses in play for any given hashtag as5
American EthnologistVolume 42  Number 1  February 2015well as the stances and perspectives associated with anygiven use. In the case of #Ferguson, patterns emerged inwhich Twitter became a platform for providing emergentinformation about the killing of Michael Brown and forcommenting on the treatment of the officer who shothim. For example, one user posted, “Prosecutors get realfriendly when they have to adjudicate one of their own.But they’ll move heaven and earth hunting POC down.#Ferguson.”10In contrast, other tweets recontextualizedthe situation in Ferguson as part of global affairs (e.g.,“#Egypt #Palestine #Ferguson #Turkey, U.S. made tear gas,sold on the almighty free market represses democracy”),while others critiqued the appropriation of this event(e.g., “seriously though, @FCKH8 never posted ANYTHINGon their Facebook page in support of #Ferguson untilit was time to sell some t-shirts”11). Meanwhile, sometweets combined these genres, such as those involvingself-promotion of one’s own broader commentary onFerguson (e.g., “People are talking about #Ferguson all overthe world. Here’s a interview I did for a newspaper in Italy,”along with a link to an Instagram photo of a newspaperstory) and juxtapositions of #Ferguson with commentaryon mundane aspects of one’s everyday life (e.g., “It’s 3:30 ...I’m acting like I don’t gotta be up at 7:30 #Ferguson #Hand-sUp #MichaelBrown”). This range of uses of #Ferguson,which encompasses both prevailing and emergent scripts,demonstrates the importance of considering perspec-tive and function in analyzing intertexual links betweentweets.In addition to these intertextual considerations, hash-tags also have the interdiscursive capacity to lasso ac-companying texts and their indexical meanings as partof a frame. Linkages across hashtags and their accom-panying texts—which comprise both other hashtags (e.g.,#Ferguson, #MichaelBrown, #HandsUp, etc.) and additionalcommentary—frame #Ferguson as a kind of mediatizedplace.12It is in this sense that much like one could goto the library, stand in front of a call number, and findtexts on a particular subject, one could go onto Twit-ter, type #Ferguson, and find a large number of postson the subject at hand. But what is the relationship be-tween this mediatized place—as it is experienced fromoutside the boundaries of the geographical context withwhich it is associated—and everyday life in what mightbe understood as Ferguson proper? How does the medi-atization of Ferguson, Missouri, through #Ferguson leadto the formation of new “ad hoc publics” (Bruns andBurgess 2011)?13The types of publics created by Twitter emerge from thehashtag’s capacity to serve not just as an indexing systembut also as a filter that allows social media users to reducethe noise of Twitter by cutting into one small slice. However,this filtering process also has a distorting effect. Social me-dia create a distorted view of events, such that we only getthe perspective of the people who are already in our socialnetwork (Garret and Resnick 2011; Pariser 2012; Sunstein2009). This effect should signal one of the first cautions foranthropologists interested in social media: We must avoidthe common slippage made by journalists and others whotend to represent Twitter as an unproblematized “publicsphere” without taking into account the complexity of whois on Twitter, as well as how people are on Twitter in dif-ferent ways (e.g., some are constant users, others tweet in-frequently, some do so from their phone, some from theiroffice, etc.).14Part of the problem of engaging in hashtag ethnogra-phy, then, is that it is difficult to assess the context of socialmedia utterances. Moreover, a simple statement of fact—forexample, that there were eight million Ferguson tweets—tells us very little. How many were critical of the police?How many were critical of the protestors? How many wereposted by journalists (both professional and amateur)? Be-yond knowing that people tweeted, we know little aboutwhat those tweets meant to their authors and their imag-ined publics. We do not know, for example, how many ofthe eight million tweets were aimed at a national audience(and thus appropriately hashtagged for quick retrieval andretweet) versus how many were aimed at a smaller groupof followers with the contextual information necessary toassess both the explicit and implicit uses of hashtags andother references.In thinking about the hashtag as a field site, thesequestions and the competing perspectives they highlightdemonstrate the importance of reorienting social mediaethnography from an emphasis on “network and commu-nity” toward a focus on individual experiences, practices,and socialities (Postill and Pink 2012:124). For example,some have argued that in assessing the importance ofTwitter in the Ferguson protests, we must take into accountthat, despite the enduring digital divide within the UnitedStates, the percentage of African Americans who use Twitter(22 percent) is much higher than that of white Americans(16 percent; Bryers 2014). While these simple figures tellus little about the ways and frequency with which thesegroups use the system and to what ends, the significance ofwhat has been called “Black Twitter” (Florini 2014; Sharma2013) should not be overlooked. As we discuss below,Twitter affords a unique platform for collectively identify-ing, articulating, and contesting racial injustices from thein-group perspectives of racialized populations. Whereasin most mainstream media contexts the experiences ofracialized populations are overdetermined, stereotyped,or tokenized, social media platforms such as Twitter offersites for collectively constructing counternarratives andreimagining group identities.15In the case of Ferguson, it is worth noting that, at leastinitially, the most common use of the #Ferguson hashtagwas to convey information about the unfolding events.6
#FergusonAmerican EthnologistBefore the mainstream media had caught up to what washappening, the mass of hashtagged tweets was a way ofcalling attention to an underreported incident of policebrutality. Well aware of the algorithmic nature of Twitter,users were purposefully hashtagging to make Ferguson“trend.”16However, once Ferguson had stabilized as animportant news event, many began tweeting about theevents without necessarily marking their posts with a hash-tag. Some local residents, for example, marked their tweets#STL (i.e., the common hashtag for a post referencing St.Louis), and others did not mark their tweets at all. The onlyway to really know what these tweets were “about” was toview them in the context of the individual tweeters them-selves: when they were posting, what they had previouslyposted, who they had begun following, and what they wereretweeting.By looking only at tweets marked #Ferguson, one wouldmiss out on a large number of posts that were “about” Fer-guson even though they were not marked as such.17In manyways, these tweets form part of the nonplace that is #Fer-guson, much as diasporic communities are part of a placecalled “home.” If we are to take a hashtag seriously as afield site, we must thus not assume its fixed and stableboundaries—any more than we would with other field sites,which can also appear to be isolated, bounded, and ho-mogenous but are, in practice, much more dispersed, inter-connected, and diffuse (Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Trouillot2003).However, recognizing that hashstags can only ever of-fer a limited, partial, and filtered view of a social worlddoes not require abandoning them as sites of analysis.Rather, we must approach them as what they are: en-try points into larger and more complex worlds. Hash-tags offer a window to peep through, but it is only bystepping through that window and “following” (in bothTwitter and non-Twitter terms) individual users that wecan begin to place tweets within a broader context. Thiskind of analysis requires us to stay with those who tweetand follow them after hashtags have fallen out of “trend.”Only then can we better understand what brings themto this virtual place and what they take away from theirengagement.18The whole world is tweetingSocial movements have long used media and technologyto disseminate, escalate, and enlarge the scope of theirstruggles: Transistor radios allowed Cuban guerrilla fight-ers to transmit from the Sierra Maestra; television coveragetransformed the riots in Selma, Alabama, into a nationalevent; and e-mail accounts allowed Zapatistas in Chiapasto launch global communiqu ́es. #Ferguson did what manyof these other tools did: It allowed a message to get out,called global attention to a small corner of the world, and at-tempted to bring visibility and accountability to repressiveforces.19One of the differences between Twitter and these ear-lier forms of technology, however, is its multivocality and di-alogicality (Bakhtin 1981). Twitter does not just allow you topeer through a window; it allows you to look through man-ifold windows at once. On #Ferguson, you could watch sixsimultaneous live streams. You could read what protestorswere tweeting, what journalists were reporting, what thepolice was announcing, and how observers and analysts in-terpreted the unfolding events. You could also learn howthousands of users were reacting to the numerous posts.In the era of transistor radios and television sets, one didnot necessarily know what listeners or viewers yelled backat their machines, but on Twitter one can get a sense of in-dividual responses to mediatized events.E-mail, television, radio, and print have long managedto open up windows into the experience of social move-ments, but the dialogicality and temporality of Twitter cre-ate a unique feeling of direct participation. Twitter allowsusers who are territorially displaced to feel like they areunited across both space and time. For example, duringthe 2014 World Cup (just a month before the events inFerguson), the Nigerian American novelist and avid tweeterTeju Cole encouraged his followers to post pictures of theirindividual views of the matches and to mark these postswith the hashtag #The time of the game.20“We live in dif-ferent time zones, out of sync but aware of each other,” hewrote, “then the game begins and we enter the same time:the time of the game” (Meyer 2014). For Cole, the point wasto highlight how a global audience could enter into a sharedtemporality that he described as “public time” (a counter-part to public space).#Ferguson and its attendant live streams created asimilar feeling of shared temporality—particularly duringthe protests and confrontations with police. As opposedto someone who mightpost  aboutFerguson on Face-book, users on Twitter felt like they wereparticipating in#Ferguson, as they tweeted in real time about the un-folding events, rallied supporters to join various hashtagcampaigns (discussed below), and monitored live streamswhere they could bear witness to the tear gassing andarrests of journalists and protestors. Engaging in theseactivities is akin to participating in a protest in the sensethat it offers an experience of “real time” engagement,community, and even collective effervescence. Throughthis form of participation, users can experience the height-ened temporality that characterizes all social movements:the way days marked by protest become “eventful,”distinguishing them from quotidian life. The “eventfulness”of protest-filled days cannot be easily summed up in datednews bulletins; indeed, they often challenge calendricaltime itself—thus, not coincidentally, social movementactors often develop their own revolutionary calendars,7
American EthnologistVolume 42  Number 1  February 2015chronicles, timelines, and alternative forms of markingpolitical time.21It was partly because of this heightenedtemporality that, as others have noted, the news sur-rounding Michael Brown’s death dominated Twitter muchmore than Facebook.22Facebook moved too slowly for theeventfulness of Ferguson. For the denizens of #Ferguson,the posts on Facebook were “yesterday’s news”—alwaysalready superseded by the latest round of tweets.23Hashtag activism versus “real” activism?Many have disparaged hashtag activism as a poor substitutefor “real” activism, and, indeed, some suggest that the viral-ity and ephemerality of social media can only ever producefleeting “nanostories” (Wasik 2009) with little lasting im-pact. However, it is important to examine how and why dig-ital activism has become salient to particular populations. Itis surely not coincidental that the groups most likely to ex-perience police brutality, to have their protests disparagedas acts of “rioting” or “looting,” and to be misrepresented inthe media are precisely those turning to digital activism atthe highest rates. Indeed, some of the most important hash-tag campaigns emerging out of #Ferguson were targeted atcalling attention to both police practices and media rep-resentations, suggesting that social media can serve as animportant tool for challenging these various forms of racialprofiling.The first of these campaigns was inspired by eyewitnessreports that Michael Brown had his hands up in the air as asign of surrender and had uttered the wordsdon’t shootjustbefore he was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson. Ini-tial activism around Michael Brown thus revolved aroundthe hashtag #HandsUpDontShoot, often accompanied byphotos of individuals or groups of people with their handsup.24One of the most widely circulated images from thismeme was that of Howard University students with theirhands up. (See Figure 1.)Through this campaign, users sought to call attentionto the arbitrary nature of racialized policing, the vulnera-bility of black bodies, and the problematic ways in whichblackness is perceived as a constant threat.25BecauseMichael Brown was allegedly shot while holding his handsup, #HandsUpDontShoot also became a tool for contestingvictim-blaming or respectability narratives rooted in thebelief that one can control the perception of one’s body andthe violence inflicted on it. These efforts echoed a previous“meme” that emerged in response to the killing of anotherunarmed African American teenager, Trayvon Martin, twoyears earlier.26Shortly following Martin’s killing, a recordingof the 911 call made by George Zimmerman, the killer,describing Martin as someone “suspicious” wearing a “darkhoodie,” circulated widely in the press. Fox News com-mentator Geraldo Rivera suggested that the hoodie was“as much responsible for Trayvon Martin’s death as GeorgeZimmerman” (Geraldo Rivera: “Leave the Hoodie at Home”2012). Rivera argued that hoodies had become emblematicof criminal behavior, given their ubiquitous presence incrime-suspect drawings and surveillance footage of pettytheft. This argument elides the role that race plays in struc-turing the hoodie’s alternate status as an innocuous pieceof clothing versus a sign of criminality or deviance. That is,hoodies are only signs of criminal behavior when they arecontextualized in relation to particular racialized bodies.27Many commentators sought to draw attention to this point.In the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death, the hoodie becamea powerful symbol, with events like the “Million HoodieMarch” drawing hundreds of supporters. Online activismat the time included the circulation of images of userswearing hoodies, marked with the hashtags #HoodiesUpand #WeAreTrayvonMartin in a sign of solidarity.Immediately following Trayvon Martin’s killing, manysocial media users changed their profile pictures to imagesof themselves wearing hooded sweatshirts with the hoodsup. Similarly, in the wake of Michael Brown’s death, manyposted profile pictures of themselves with their hands up.These instances show how the seemingly vacuous practiceof taking “selfies” (i.e., photos of oneself) can become polit-ically meaningful in the context of racialized bodies. Theseimages represent acts of solidarity that seek to humanizethe victims of police brutality by suggesting that a similarfate could befall other similarly construed bodies.28Two of the other popular memes that emerged in thewake of #Ferguson also focused on representations of blackbodies and, specifically, on media portrayals of MichaelBrown. The first of these emerged as a response to the pho-tograph that mainstream media initially circulated in thewake of his death. The image sparked controversy becauseit showed Michael Brown making a hand gesture that, forsome, represented a peace sign and, for others, a gangsign. Like Trayvon Martin’s hoodie, the very same handgesture could be alternately interpreted as a sign of peaceor criminality depending on the racialized body with whichit is associated. In response, Twitter users began usingthe hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown to post contrastingpictures of themselves along with various versions of thequestion “which picture would they use?” For example,18-year-old Houston native Tyler Atkins (featured in aNewYork  Timesarticle about the meme) posted a picture ofhimself after a jazz concert in his high school, wearing ablack tuxedo with his saxophone suspended from a neckstrap. This was juxtaposed with a photo taken while filminga rap video with a friend, in which he is wearing a blackT-shirt and a blue bandanna tied around his head and hisfinger is pointed at the camera. (See Figure 2.)Once again, these images represent an act of soli-darity. They suggest that anyone could be represented aseither respectable and innocent or violent and criminal—depending on the staging of the photograph. This campaign8
#FergusonAmerican EthnologistFigure 1.Image of students at Howard University with their hands up. Posted to Twitter on November 16, 2014, by David Flores with the text “#100DaysOfIn-justice #Ferguson #HandsUpDontShoot.” (Image courtesy of David Flores.)speaks to larger concerns over privacy in an era when pri-vate photos and surveillance footage are routinely leaked,hacked, and repurposed to nefarious ends. More impor-tantly, it also speaks to an acute awareness among youngAfrican Americans of how black bodies are particularlyvulnerable to misrepresentation by mainstream media(Vega 2014).The final hashtag campaign we mention here speaksdirectly to this issue. It emerged in response to aNew YorkTimesprofile of Michael Brown released on the day of hisfuneral, which described the 18-year-old as “no angel”(Elignon 2014). The piece suggested that Brown “dabbled indrugs and alcohol” and had been involved in “at least onescuffle with a neighbor.” Many saw this as a tasteless, unfairportrayal and an extension of the attempted smear cam-paign carried out by the local police, who had released whatthey themselves admitted was “unrelated” surveillancevideo of a purported act of shoplifting at a conveniencestore. In response, Twitter users began using the hashtag#NoAngel to highlight the mainstream media’s inability toacknowledge the possibility of black victimhood or inno-cence. For example, one person tweeted, “I am #NoAngel,so I guess I deserve to be murdered too. Yep, perfectlyacceptable to gun down a person if they aren’t a Saint.”The use of hashtags such as #HandsUpDontShoot,#IfTheyGunnedMeDown,  and  #NoAngel  speak  to  thelong history of inaccurate and unfair portrayal of AfricanAmericans within mainstream media and to the system-atic profiling and victim blaming suffered by racializiedbodies. Their use suggests that while social media mightseem like a space of disembodied engagement, for many,social media can become an important site in which toforeground the particular ways in which racialized bodiesare systematically stereotyped, stigmatized, surveilled, andpositioned as targets of state-sanctioned violence.29Thesehashtag campaigns, which seek to identify the insidiousnature of contemporary racism, can thus be understood asa powerful response to the “racial paranoia” (Jackson 2008)associated with African Americans’ ongoing experiences ofabject inequality in an age of alleged colorblindness.The effort to bring attention to this inequality is pow-erfully captured by the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, whichemerged in July 2013, after George Zimmerman was acquit-ted of Trayvon Martin’s murder. Many Twitter users alsodrew on this hashtag in response to the killing of MichaelBrown. It is important to understand #BlackLivesMatter notsimply as a general statement about the inherent value ofblack life in the face of state-sanctioned racial violence butalso as a reflection of the ways that social media can becomea site for the revaluation of black materiality. As illustratedin the memes described above, participants often used pho-tos of themselves to contest the racialized devaluation oftheir persons. Whereas, in face-to-face interactions, racial-ized young people like the ones described above might notbe able to contest the meanings ascribed to their bodies(or impede the deadly violence exerted on them by the po-lice), through their creative reinterpretations on social me-dia, they are able to rematerialize their bodies in alternativeways. With these creative acts, they seek to document, con-test, and ultimately transform their quotidian experiencesby simultaneously asserting the fundamental value and theparticularity of their embodiment both on- and off-line.All that is tweeted melts into air?It is clear that platforms like Twitter have become essentialto contemporary social actors, but the long-lasting effects ofdigital modes of activism remain hotly debated. For some,9
American EthnologistVolume 42  Number 1  February 2015Figure 2.Image tweeted on August 10, 2014, by Tyler Atkins with the post “#IfTheyGunnedMeDown which picture would they use.” (Photo courtesy ofTyler Atkins.)these acts represent fleeting moments of awareness, quicklyreplaced by the customary innocuousness of social mediapleasantries. For others, however, participation in forms ofdigital activism prove transformative in unpredictable ways.For, although Twitter activism is said to be fleeting by na-ture, it is also inherently aggregative. It is thus important torecognize that the reactions to the death of Michael Browndid not spark in a vacuum; they were fueled by accumu-lated frustrations over previously mediatized moments ofinjustice and guided by previous digital campaigns. Thisaggregative effect powerfully positions different instancesof racialized brutality not simply as isolated contemporaryphenomena but as long-standing systematic forms of vio-lence associated with what has been described as a “stateof racial expendability” that is fundamental to the logics ofU.S. sovereignty (Marquez 2012).30As Johnetta Elzie, a 25-year-old protestor profiled in themagazine theNation,explained, “We saw it with TrayvonMartin. We saw it with Jordan Davis—but I always felt awayfrom everything. Then I saw Brown’s body laying out there,and I said, ‘Damn, they did it again!’ But now that it hap-pened in my home, I’m not just going to tweet about itfrom the comfort of my bed. So I went down there” (Hsiehand Rakia 2014). Elzie’s words hint at how face-to-faceand digital forms of activism work in interrelated and ag-gregative ways. Although she draws a distinction betweentweeting from the comfort of her home and physical pres-ence at an event, her narrative shows how these contextsare interrelated and build on each other—even beyondthe confines of one particular historical event or hashtagcampaign.The article goes on to describe how Elzie encounteredother activists involved in the protests through their shareduse of social media, stating, “They quickly developed atight-knit community, sustained by their addiction tosocial media. Together, they live-tweeted, Vined and In-stagrammed every protest, through the sweltering daysand tumultuous nights, as well as the direct actions takingplace elsewhere in the St. Louis area.” The group eventuallytook on the name Millennial Activists United and shiftedtheir role from “documenting” their actions to “generating”new forms of social community, for instance, through theuse of #FergusonFriday to create a space for reflectionon the movement, the creation of a daily newsletterThisIs  The  Movementto spread news and reflection piecesabout unfolding events, and the organization of national10
#FergusonAmerican Ethnologist“fireside” conference calls during which activists basedin Ferguson could speak directly with those following theevents from afar.31The ways these activists shift seamlesslyacross spaces and modes of engagement underscore theslippery boundary between analog and digital forms ofactivism. Indeed, it is unclear if #HandsUpDontShoot and#JusticeForMichaelBrown represent the use of political slo-gans as hashtags or if they represent the use of hasthags asslogans. This ambiguity reflects the dynamic, multimodalnature of these activist efforts.32Most observers of contemporary social movementswould agree that what is needed is not simply “in-ternet ethnography” but “internet related ethnography”(Postill and Pink 2012:3) that follows users across multipleonline and off-line communities to better understand howdigital and analog forms of engagement are mutually con-stitutive (Juris 2012:260). In the wake of Michael Brown’skilling, new sites of struggle have appeared, fueled by boththe events in Ferguson and by the events of #Ferguson,#HandsUp, and #JusticeForMichaelBrown. Some of theseefforts are visible through digital windows like #BlackLives-Matter, #FergusonOctober, and #FergusonFriday, but oth-ers are not necessarily marked and codified for easy digitalretrieval. Anthropologists interested in these social worldsshould thus remain attentive to the possibilities of hashtagethnography while still being prepared to read between andgo beyond the digital lines.Supplemental material for this article is available onthe AE website. For links to further resources on theFerguson protests; tweets, videos, and images circulatedduring the period; and websites where readers canfollow the Ferguson story as it continues to unfold, seehttp://americanethnologist.org/2015/ferguson-digital-protest-february-2015/.PostscriptOn November 24, 2014, after a grand jury released its deci-sion not to indict Darren Wilson, Ferguson went viral onceagain, with over 3.5 million tweets appearing in a matter ofhours under the hashtag #FergusonDecision. That evening,and in the days that followed, protestors took to the streetsacross the nation and beyond to decry the decision, theoverall handling of Michael Brown’s case by the justice sys-tem, and racialized police brutality more broadly. Demon-strators staged “death-ins” at city intersections and shop-ping malls, they lined suburban sidewalks face down inmemory of Michael Brown’s lifeless body, and they broughttraffic in several cities across the United States to a halt,shutting down multilane highways, bridges, tunnels, andmodes of public transportation. Many wore T-shirts pro-claiming “I am Mike Brown” and held signs calling for theneed to “Indict America.” These demonstrations led socialmedia users to claim that “#Ferguson is everywhere,” em-phasizing the connection between online and offline formsof protest.The release of the grand jury hearing transcripts alsooffered a new view of the events as narrated by DarrenWilson, who had until that moment remained silent. Histestimony—particularly his description of Michael Brownas “a demon,” as a larger-than-life figure, and his use ofthe pronounitto refer to the 18-year-old—offered furtherinsight into the distorted lens through which black bodiesare read by representatives of the state. Michael Brown andDarren Wilson were both 6’4” tall and weighed 290 poundsand 210 pounds, respectively, yet, in his testimony and intelevision interviews, Wilson said he felt like “a 5-year-oldholding on to Hulk Hogan.” Wilson’s characterization ofhimself as a child and of Brown as a superhuman monsterbecame part of an exculpatory narrative in which the un-armed teenager was framed as the true threat, not the po-lice officer who shot and killed him. In his testimony, Dar-ren Wilson affirmed that he had done nothing wrong andexpressed no remorse for his actions. Describing the mo-ment of Michael Brown’s death, he stated that, as the bul-lets entered the young man’s body, “the demeanor on hisface went blank, the aggression was gone, it was gone, ...the threat was stopped.” Wilson’s reverse logic, sanctionedby the state, presents a narrative in which an unarmedteenager is a terrifying aggressor and an armed police of-ficer is an innocent victim. This inversion underscores thesignificance of affirming that #BlackLivesMatter in a con-text where they are disproportionately viewed as threats bystate forces and mainstream institutions.The same week of the Ferguson grand jury decision,news broke of the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Riceby Cleveland police after a 911 caller reported a “guy” witha gun. The gun was probably fake, the caller had said, and“it” (referring to Rice) was “probably a juvenile,” but, still,the mere sight of the boy with a toy gun “is scaring the shitout of me,” the caller insisted. Police were dispatched, andthey shot the boy dead within two seconds of encounter-ing him. This event made clear once again state agents’ dis-torted views of black Americans, especially teenagers—howtheir very bodies are perceived as looming, larger-than-lifethreats and how any objects in their possession (e.g., can-dies, sodas, toys, articles of clothing) are read as weapons.Once again, the media focused not on state action buton the worthiness of black bodies. Local news immediatelyran profiles of Rice’s parents, noting that they both had “vi-olent pasts” (his father had been charged with domestic vi-olence and his mother with drug possession). This history,reporters argued, could help explain why Tamir Rice wouldbe inclined to play with a toy gun in a public place. Un-der fire for its coverage, the Northeast Ohio Media Groupclaimed, “One way to stop police from killing any more11
American EthnologistVolume 42  Number 1  February 201512-year-olds might be to understand the forces that leadchildren to undertake behavior that could put them in thesights of police guns.” There was no discussion of a national“gun culture,” as there often is in incidents involving youthand guns (though, in this case, the “gun” was a toy), nor wasthere any discussion of the structural violence that Rice andhis family engaged with on a daily basis or of the distortedways young black bodies are viewed when they end up “inthe sights” of police guns.Within this context, social media participation be-comes a key site from which to contest mainstream me-dia silences and the long history of state-sanctioned vio-lence against racialized populations. Upon announcing theFerguson grand jury decision, St. Louis prosecutor RobertMcCulloch claimed that media coverage, and particularlysocial media, had posed “the most significant challenge”to his investigation. Social media cast a spotlight on thissmall Missouri township, but more importantly, by pro-pelling Ferguson into a broader, mediatized, virtual space,social media users were able to show that “#Ferguson iseverywhere”—not only in the sense of a broad public spherebut also in the sense of the underlying social and politicalrelationships that haunt the nation as a whole.Links to sources and additional information re-garding the grand jury verdict and the protests thatfollowed  are  available  on  theAEwebsite:  http://americanethnologist.org/2015/ferguson-digital-protest-february-2015/.NotesAcknowledgments. We would like to thank Max Hantel for hisdeft research assistance and commentary on earlier versions of thispiece, Angelique Haugerud for her encouragement and thoughtfuladvice throughout the editorial process, and the anonymousAEre-viewers for their pointed questions and suggestions.1. For a timeline of events in these early moments, see Laurie2014. At present, it remains an open question to what extent Twitterposts should be treated like confidential “data” obtained from hu-man subjects or like quotations from published texts. Throughoutthis article, we have thus thought carefully about when to quote,cite, or paraphrase from Twitter posts. We have used the real namesof Twitter users when discussing tweets that went “viral” or werefeatured in mainstream media reports. However, when quotingor paraphrasing from unreported tweets, we have chosen not toreproduce the username of the author—erring on the site of pri-vacy at the expense of offering proper attribution. Legally speaking,Twitter users have agreed to publish their posts by accepting theplatform’s “terms of service,” and in this sense tweets operatesimilarly to YouTube videos, which are publicly available, archived,and citable. Indeed, the Library of Congress is currently in theprocess of archiving all public tweets dating back to 2006. However,it is unclear whether individual users of the service are fully awareof this archival possibility and its implications. For, althoughTwitter posts are public, they are not necessarily imagined to bepermanent: At present, any post can be retroactively deleted, user-names can be easily changed, and entire accounts can be erased.(These actions are achieved much more easily on Twitter than onFacebook.) Among journalists, these questions have been hotly de-bated. Although one can easily cite Twitter users without their per-mission, some feel that “journalists should let people know whenthey’re performing journalism,” as one commentator suggests(Chittal 2012). Among scholars, there have been similar debates.Many argue that researchers should not depend on corporate useragreements and should instead obtain informed consent fromindividual users before harvesting posts as “data” (see boyd andCrawford 2012; Zimmer 2010; Zimmer and Proferes 2014). Thisissue becomes all the more complicated as we increasingly learnof how corporations like Facebook and Twitter are harvestingtheir own data for internal research, marketing, and developmentpurposes.Although it is important to debate the ethical concerns sur-rounding “Twitter research,” we would caution against viewingthese as entirely new, or disconnected from previous methodologi-cal and ethical debates in social science research. The fact is, theseissues speak to long-standing anthropological concerns regard-ing “misinformed consent” through either a user agreement or asigned institutional review board form (du Toit 1980; Sankar 2004;Wax 1980), the implications of using “naturally occurring” versus“elicited” communication (Dobrin 2008; Wolfson 1976), and thelarger question of the general role and purpose of the “native voice”in anthropological texts (Bonilla n.d.; Trouillot 2003). Engagementwith these questions in the context of digital platforms should thusnot be set apart from discussions of “analog” methods and ethicalconcerns.2. Some commentators have noted the greater attention di-rected toward these events as compared to miscarriages of justiceinvolving black women, such as Renisha McBride (who was mur-dered while seeking help following a car accident), Marissa Alexan-der (who was not afforded access to the same “Stand Your Ground”defense used to exonerate George Zimmerman in the killing ofTrayvon Martin; she received, instead, a mandatory minimum sen-tence of 20 years for firing a warning shot in the air after she wasattacked by her husband), and Mariene Pinnock (whose beating atthe hands of California Highway Patrol officers was captured onvideo). For a discussion of the intersectional politics of race andgender that shape this disparate coverage, see Gebreyes 2014.3. The protests in Ferguson did not quickly fade. Indeed, as thisarticle was being drafted, a new hashtag, #FergusonOctober, begantrending as people from across and beyond the United States gath-ered in Ferguson from October 10 to October 13, 2014, “to buildmomentum for a nationwide movement against police violence.”See Ferguson October 2014.4. One could go even further back historically and examine howthe image of Emmett Till, released by his mother for publication inJetmagazine, served as an important catalyst for the Civil Rightsmovement. See Adams 2004 to listen to firsthand accounts of thisdecision and its impact.5. A recent study by the Pew Research Center (Smith 2013) in-dicates that 53 percent of white Americans, 64 percent of AfricanAmericans, and 60 percent of U.S. Latinos/as own smartphones.6. While some audiences have interpreted increased mediatiza-tion of such events as a sign of increased rates of police brutality,many others have pointed out that police brutality has always beenrampant in communities of color, particularly African Americanand Latina/o communities. These perspectives represent contrast-ing, racialized chronotopes (Agha 2007; Bakhtin 1981; Silverstein2005), or space-time constructions. From the vantage point of pre-dominantly white communities that have not faced it, police bru-tality is often viewed as a practice taking place “there” and “now”(i.e., a specifically contemporary phenomenon in communities ofcolor); from the vantage point of people of color who have faced12
#FergusonAmerican Ethnologistpolice brutality in their communities for generations, such brutal-ity is often viewed as a practice that has “always” taken place “here”(i.e., it is a long-standing, ongoing phenomenon in predominantlyminority communities). These contrasting racialized chronotopesshape perceptions of the scale of police brutality and responsesto it.7. The importance of citizen journalism and journalistic usesof social media became even more evident once it was revealedthat local police and the U.S. government collaborated to es-tablish a no-fly zone over the Ferguson area in efforts to resistaerial media coverage of confrontations between protestors andthe militarized police force (Gillum and Lowy 2014). For more onthe tactics used during the Ferguson protests and their possibleviolation of civil rights, see the report released by Amnesty In-ternational (2014). It is worth noting that Ferguson marked thefirst time the organization deployed observers within the UnitedStates.8. While a full assessment of Twitter is beyond the scope of thisarticle, a few demographic trends are worth noting. Despite earlystatistical dominance, the United States is no longer the per capitaleader in Twitter activity; however, it remains the nation with thehighest number of users (Lipman 2014). Within the United States,urban dwellers are much more likely than suburban or rural resi-dents to use Twitter, a fact that is certainly relevant to any compre-hensive account of social movements (Duggan and Brenner 2013).There is also a seeming feedback loop between political unrest andlanguage usage: For example, the use of Arabic surged in 2010 asTwitter became a clearinghouse for information about demonstra-tions in Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, and beyond (Seshagiri 2014). And,within different languages, some studies suggest the hashtag itselffunctions differently (see Weerkamp et al. 2011). As anthropologistsgrapple with virtual field sites, it will be important to keep in mindhow geographic differences contour the experience of online inter-action.9. They thus recall Stephan Palmi ́e’s (2013) description of the Li-brary of Congress call number BL2532.S3 as a place where Santer ́ıaresides.10. POC is an acronym for people of color.11. “@FCKH8” is the Twitter handle of a company that sells T-shirts with activist themes. The author of this tweet is accusing thecompany of using the events in Ferguson as an opportunity to gen-erate profit.12. John Postill (2014) has noted the ways that the use ofmultiple, novel hashtags reflects savvy social media users’ un-derstanding that Twitter rewards novelty over raw numbers in itstrending algorithms. The relationships between these hashtags andtheir accompanying texts can be conceptualized as comparatively“type-” and “token-” oriented interdiscursive links (Silverstein2005). Whereas token oriented interdiscursivities highlight par-ticular events (e.g., accounts of the shooting of Michael Brownand specific police responses to protests in a given moment),type-focused interdiscursivities address issues related to genres ofcommunication and interaction (e.g., police brutality in general,patterns in media coverage surrounding the victimization of racial-ized peoples). Collectively, these interdiscursivities constitute themediatized eventness of #Ferguson (Agha 2011) and the potentialways it can be recontextualized in relation to other such particularevents and genres of events (Briggs and Bauman 1992).13. Crucially, the leaky boundaries that correspond to publicsmore broadly certainly pertain to mediatized publics (Gal andWoolard 2001). That is, the publicness and counterpublicness(Warner 2002) of #Ferguson must be understood as a performativecontext with the potential to be mobilized as part of social projectsacross individual and collective scales.14. For more on the challenges these kinds of questions pose tostudies engaging “Big Data” such as Twitter analysis, see boyd andCrawford 2012 and Reyes 2014.15. In addition to “Black Twitter” we must also think about “Me-dia Twitter” and how journalists negotiate professional norms intheir Twitter use (Lasorsa et al. 2012). In the context of the Fergu-son protests, several journalists used Twitter to document the chal-lenges they were facing as they covered the events, including thepossibility of arrest. Attention to these practices is essential to theproject of “provincializing” digital media (Coleman 2010:489).16. Trending is also achieved through “retweeting”—a crucial as-pect of Twitter engagement. Any user’s tweet can be “favorited,”“retweeted,” and “quoted” by another user. The number of favoritesand retweets, which can be seen on the original tweet, is often in-terpreted as a sign of a given tweet’s popularity. Abbreviations suchas MT (i.e., modified tweet) and RT (i.e., retweet) can be used tomanually quote or retweet. This range of quotation practices leadsto debates about authorship and disputes over whether users arestrategically quoting popular users to attract more followers. In thecontext of #Ferguson, particular users, such as Antonio French (al-derman of St. Louis’s 21st Ward) and Wesley Lowery (a reporter fortheWashington Post), emerged as key informants whose on-the-ground accounts in Ferguson were retweeted by thousands of Twit-ter users. As an article inUSA Todaydocuments, over the course ofthe Ferguson events, Antonio French experienced a huge surge inpopularity, going from around four thousand to 121 thousand fol-lowers in less than a month. See Mandaro 2014. This surge did notgo unnoticed by local residents, some of whom have tweeted thatpoliticians used the events to further their own careers.17. This point is not exclusive to posts about Ferguson. Broadlyspeaking, in analyzing Twitter usage, we must think carefully aboutwhen and why users feel the need to hashtag their posts. For ex-ample, users who post commentary about a specific TV show whilethat show is being broadcast often do not use a hashtag, presum-ably because they are tweeting to followers who are also watchingthe show at that moment in time. These tweets are not retrievablethrough hashtag searches, and, indeed, it is impossible to knowwhat they are “about” unless one is viewing the tweets in real timeor carefully reading a given user’s timeline. Thus, the hashtag is justone possible way of creating eventness via Twitter.18. Among those who write about “digital worlds” there is signif-icant debate about the kinds of lines that should be drawn between“online” and “offline” realms (see Horst and Miller 2012). However,it is worth noting that many who tweeted about #Ferguson fromoutside Missouri eventually felt the need to visit the town of Fergu-son and noted a sharp difference between these two sites. (See, e.g.,Browne 2014; Cooper 2014.) Jalani Cobb (2014), who wrote aboutFerguson for theNew Yorker,argued that, during his reporting onthe events, he developed a “between-the-world-and-Ferguson viewof the events.”19. In considerations of the use of social media to articulateshared interests and mobilize political action, the recent historyof its role in antiauthoritarian movements throughout the MiddleEast and Africa looms large. On the one hand, it is revealing to drawtransnational connections between movements opposing closedregimes abroad and the struggles of subjugated populations withinliberal democratic states. In the case of the Arab Spring, many stud-ies point to the constitutive role of social media in not only infor-mation dissemination but also tactical maneuvers and strategic ne-gotiations (see Howard et al. 2011; Lotan et al. 2011). On the otherhand, it is methodologically dangerous to always jump to the scaleof the “global rhetoric of ‘spectacle,’” as Nishant Shah (2013:667)puts it, by rendering all such movements comparatively legibleunder broad monikers like “digital activism.” Hence, the task of13
Publication loaded60contexts.orgthe algorithmic rise of the “alt-right” by jessie daniels61WINTER 2018contextsOn a late summer evening in 2017, members of the far-right descended on Charlottesville, Virginia with tiki-torches held up in defense of confederate general Robert E. Lee’s statue in what was dubbed a “Unite the Right” rally, which had been organized mostly online. The next day, August 13, White nationalists rallied again and violently clashed with counter protestors. One drove his car into a multiracial crowd, killing one and seriously injuring 19 others. As it has turned out, the events in Charlottesville were a watershed moment in the algorithmic rise of White nationalism in the U.S. White  nationalism  has  gone  “from  being  a  conversation  you could hold in a bathroom, to the front parlor,” according to William H. Regnery II. A multimillionaire, Regnery has spent a significant sum of his inherited wealth pushing his “race realist” agenda via a publishing house and the National Policy Institute, a think-tank. When his protégé and grantee, Richard Spencer, coined the new term “alt-right” in 2008, few took notice. Back then, Jared Taylor, publisher of the White nationalist site Ameri-can  Renaissance,  said  he  thought  of  his  own  efforts  as  “just  making a racket,” but now he sees himself as part of an ascen-dant social movement, with Spencer in a lead role. He, along with Jason Kessler, helped organize the rally in Charlottesville. “I think Tuesday was the most important day in the White nationalist  movement,”  Derek  Black  told  a  New  York  Times  reporter.  Black,  a  former  White  national-ist, was referring to the Tuesday following the  Charlottesville  rally,  when  the  current  occupant  of  the  White  House  repeated  White nationalist talking points defending the statues of America’s founding slavehold-ers. In that New York Times interview, Black went on to describe his shock, “... Tuesday just took my breath away. I was sitting in a coffee shop and I thought the news from this was done when I read that he had come back and he said there were good people in  the  White  nationalist  rally  and  he  salvaged  their  message.”  It’s certainly not the first time that a sitting president has openly heralded White supremacy from the oval office, but it is the first time that the ideology of White supremacy from both extreme and mainstream sources has been spread through the algorithms of search engines and social media platforms. There are two strands of conventional wisdom unfolding in popular accounts of the rise of the alt-right. One says that what’s  really  happening  can  be  attributed  to  a  crisis  in  White  identity: the alt-right is simply a manifestation of the angry White male who has status anxiety about his declining social power. Others contend that the alt-right is an unfortunate eddy in the vast ocean of Internet culture. Related to this is the idea that polarization,  exacerbated  by  filter  bubbles,  has  facilitated  the  spread of Internet memes and fake news promulgated by the alt-right. While the first explanation tends to ignore the influ-ence  of  the  Internet,  the  second  dismisses  the  importance  of  White nationalism. I contend that we have to understand both at the same time. For the better part of 20 years, I have been working with emerging technology and studying White supremacy in various forms of media. In the 1990s, I examined hundreds of printed newsletters from extremist groups and found that many of their talking points resonated with mainstream popular culture and politicians, like Pat Buchanan and Bill Clinton. After that, I left academia for a while and worked in the tech industry, where I produced online coverage of events like the 2000 presidential recount. When I returned to academic research, I did a follow-up study tracking how some of the groups I’d studied in print had—or had not—made it on to the Internet. I spent time at places  like  Stormfront,  the  White  nationalist  portal  launched  in the mid-1990s, and found that some groups had gained a much  more  nefarious  presence  than  in  their  print-only  days.  And, I interviewed young people about how they made sense Contexts, Vol. 17, Issue 1, pp. 60-65.

The rise of the alt-right is both a continuation of a centuries-old  dimension  of  racism  in  the  U.S.  and  part  of  an  emerging  media  ecosystem  powered  by  algorithms.  White  supremacy  has been a feature of the political landscape in the U.S. since the  start;  vigilante  White  supremacist  movements  have  been  a  constant  since  just  after  the  confederacy  lost  its  battle  to  continue slavery. The ideology of the contemporary alt-right is entirely consistent with earlier manifestations of extremist White supremacy, with only slightly modifications in style and emphasis. This  incarnation  is  much  less  steeped  in  Christian  symbolism  (few crosses, burning or otherwise), yet trades heavily in anti-Semitism. Even the Islamophobia among the alt-right has more to  do  with  the  racialization  of  people  who  follow  Islam  and  the long history of connecting Whiteness to citizenship in the U.S. than it does with beliefs about Christendom. Movement members aim to establish a White ethno-state, consistent with every  other  extremist,  White  nationalist  movement  and  more  than a few mainstream politicians. This  iteration  is  newly  enabled  by  algorithms,  which  do  several things. Algorithms deliver search results for those who seek confirmation for racist notions and connect newcomers to like-minded racists, as when Dylan Roof searched for “black on white crime” and Google provided racist websites and a com-munity of others to confirm and grow his hatred. Algorithms speed up the spread of White supremacist ideology, as when memes  like  “Pepe  the  Frog”  travel  from  4chan  or  Reddit  to  mainstream  news  sites.  And  algorithms,  aided  by  cable  news  networks, amplify and systematically move White supremacist talking  points  into  the  mainstream  of  political  discourse.  Like  always, White nationalists are being “innovation opportunists,” finding openings in the latest technologies to spread their mes-sage. To understand how all this works, it’s necessary to think about  several  things  at  once:  how  race  is  embedded  in  the  Internet at the same time it is ignored, how White supremacy operates now, and the ways these interact.building race into the “race-less” internetThe rise of the alt-right would not be possible without the infrastructure built by the tech industry, and yet, the industry likes to imagine itself as creating a “race-less” Internet. In a 1997 ad from a now-defunct telecom company, the Internet was touted as  a  “place  where  we  can  communicate  mind-to-mind,  where  there is no race, no gender, no infirmities... only minds.” Then narration poses the question, “Is this utopia?” as the word is typed out. “No, the Internet.” In many ways, the ad reflected what was then a rather obscure document, written by John Perry Barlow in 1996. Barlow, a recently deceased co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, a  manifesto-style  manuscript  in which he conceives of the Internet as a “place,”  much  like  the  imaginary  Ameri-can  frontier  in  a  Hollywood  western,  that  should  remain  free  from  control  by  “gov-ernments  of  the  industrial  world,”  those  “weary giants of flesh and steel.” He ends with a grand hope for building “a civiliza-tion of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.” While the giddy notion of a “mind-to-mind” utopia online may seem quaint by the standards of today’s “don’t-read-the-comments” Internet, Barlow’s view remains, more than 20 years later, foundational in Silicon Valley. And it informs thinking in the tech industry when it comes to the alt-right. When several tech companies kicked alt-right users off their platforms after Charlottesville,  they  were  met  with  a  vigorous  backlash  from  many in the industry. Matthew Prince, CEO and co-founder of Cloudflare, who reluctantly banned virulently racist site, The Daily Stormer, from his service, he fretted about the decision. “As [an] internet user, I think it’s pretty dangerous if my moral, political or economic whims play some role in deciding who can and cannot be online,” he said. The Electronic Frontier Foundation issued a statement that read, in part, “we believe that no one—not the government  and  not  private  commercial  enterprises—should  decide who gets to speak and who doesn’t,” closely echoing Barlow’s manifesto. Even as the dominant discourse about technology followed the “race-less” imaginary of the sales pitch and the ideology, robust  critiques  that  centered  alternative,  Afrofuturist  visions  emerged from scholars such as Alondra Nelson. Critical writing about the Internet has followed, demonstrating the myriad ways race  is  built  into  digital  technologies.  The  DOS  commands  of  “master” disk and “slave” disk prompt, Anna Everett points out, reinscribe the master/slave narrative into the level of code. Recent concerns  about  digital  surveillance  technologies  draw  much  from  pre-digital  technologies  developed  to  control  enslaved  peoples,  Simone  Browne  has  explained.  Racial  categories  are  coded into drop-down menus and the visual culture of nearly White nationalists see the “race-less” approach of platforms and the technological innovation of algorithms as opportunities to push the “Overton window,” the range of topics tolerated in public discourse.63WINTER 2018contextsToday’s “Whitelash” is algorithmically amplified, sped up, and circulated to other White ethno-nationalist movements around the world, ignored all the while by a tech industry that “doesn’t see race” in the tools it creates.every platform, Lisa Nakamura observes. The nearly ubiquitous white hand-pointer acts as a kind of avatar that, in turn, becomes “attached” to depictions of White people in advertisements, the default “universal” Internet user at the keyboard that becomes part of the collective imagination, Michele White notes. Ideas about race are inextricably linked with the development of tech products, such as “Blackbird” (a web browser) or “Ms. Dewey” (a search tool), André Brock and Miriam Sweeney have written. The  $13  billion  digital  video  gaming  industry  has  race  coded  into its interfaces and has enabled the alt-right, Kishonna Gray observes. The algorithms of search engines and their autocom-plete features often suggest racism to users and direct them to White supremacist sites, Safiya Noble documents. And it goes on.  Yet  despite  all  this  evidence  that  race  is  coded  into  these  platforms, the ideology of color-blindness in technology—both in the industry and in popular understandings of technology—serves a key mechanism enabling White nationalists to exploit technological innovations. By ignoring race in the design process and eschewing discussion of it after products are launched, the tech industry has left an opening for White nationalists—and they are always looking for opportunities to push their ideology. white nationalists as innovation opportunists The filmmaker D.W. Griffith is recognized as a cinematic visionary who helped launch an art form and an industry. His signature film, Birth of a Nation (1915), is also widely regarded as  “disgustingly  racist.”  Indeed,  White  supremacists  seized  upon it (and emerging film technology) when it was released. At  the  film’s  premiere,  members  of  the  Klan  paraded  outside  the theatre, celebrating its depiction of their group’s rise as a sign of southern White society’s recovery from the humiliation of defeat in the Civil War.  When  Griffith  screened  the  film  at  the  White  House  for  Woodrow  Wilson,  who  is  quoted  in  the  film,  the  president  declared Birth  of  a  Nation  “history  writ  with lightening.” Capitalizing on this new technology, the KKK created film compa-nies and produced their own feature films with  titles  like  The  Toll  of  Justice  (1923) and The  Traitor  Within  (1924),  screening  them at outdoor events, churches, and schools. By the middle of the 1920s, the Klan had an estimated five million members. This growth was aided by White supremacists’ recognition of the opportunity to use the new technology of motion pictures to spread their message.Almost a century later, another generation saw that same potential in digital technologies. “I believe that the internet will begin a chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the  world  by  the  speed  of  its  intellectual  conquest,”  wrote  former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke on his website in 1998. Duke’s  newsletter,  the  NAAWP  (National  Association  for  the  Advancement of White People), was part of my earlier study, and he was one who made the transition from the print-only era to the digital era. Duke joined forces with Don Black, another former KKK Grand Wizard, who shared a belief in new tech-nologies for “racial enlightenment.” Together, they helped the movement ditch Klan robes as the costume de rigueur of White supremacy and trade them for high-speed modems. Don Black created Stormfront in 1996. The site hosted a podcast  created  by  Duke  and  pushed  to  more  than  300,000  registered users at the site. Don Black’s son recalled in a recent interview that they were a family of early adopters, always look-ing for the next technological innovations that they could exploit for the White nationalist movement: “Pioneering  white  nationalism  on  the  web  was  my  dad’s goal. That was what drove him from the early ’90s, from beginning of the web. We had the latest computers, we were the first people in the neighbor-hood  to  have  broadband  because  we  had  to  keep  Stormfront running, and so technology and connect-ing people on the website, long before social media.” Part of what I observed in the shift of the White supremacist movement  from  print  to  digital  is  that  they  were  very  good,  prescient  even,  at  understanding  how  to  exploit  emerging  technologies to further their ideological goals. A few years after he launched Stormfront, Don Black cre-ated another, possibly even more pernicious site. In 1999, he registered the domain name martinlutherking.org, and set up a site that appears to be a tribute to Dr. King. But it is what I call a “cloaked site,” a sort of precursor to today’s “fake news.” Cloaked sites are a form of propaganda, intentionally disguising authorship  in  order  to  conceal  a  political  agenda.  I  originally  discovered this one through a student’s online search during a class; I easily figured out the source by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the page where it clearly says “Hosted by Stormfront.” But such sites can be deceptive: the URL is misleading and most of us, around 85%, never scroll all the way to the bottom of a page (all confirmed in interviews I did with young people while they surfed the web). So we see that White nationalists, as early adopters, are constantly looking for the vulnerabilities in new technologies as spots into which their ideology can be inserted. In the mid-1990s, it was domain name registration. The fact that 64contexts.orga site with clunky design can be deceptive is due in large part to the web address. One young participant in my study said, “it says, martin luther king dot org, so that means they must be dedicated to that.” To him, the “dot org” suffix on the domain name indicated that a non-profit group “dedicated to Dr. King” was behind the URL. White  supremacists  like  Don  Black  understood  that  the  paradigm  shift  in  media  distribution  from  the  old  broadcast  model of “one-to-many” to Internet’s “many-to-many” model was an opening. The kind of propaganda at the site about Dr. King works well in this “many-to-many” sharing environment in which there are no gatekeepers. The goal in this instance is to call into question the hard won moral, cultural, and political victories of the civil rights movement by undermining Dr. King’s personal reputation. Other cloaked sites suggest that slavery “wasn’t that bad.” This strategy, shifting the range of the acceptable ideas to discuss, is known as moving the “Overton window.” White nationalists of the alt-right are using the “race-less” approach of platforms and the technological innovation of algorithms to push the Overton window. The anything-goes approach to racist speech on platforms like  Twitter,  4chan,  and  Reddit  means  that  White  nationalists  now have many places beyond Stormfront to congregate online. These platforms have been adept in spreading White national-ist symbols and ideas, themselves accelerated and amplified by algorithms. Take “Pepe the Frog,” an innocuous cartoon char-acter that so thoroughly changed meaning that, in September 2016, the Anti-Defamation League added the character to its database of online hate symbols. This transformation began on 4chan, moved to Twitter, and, by August 2016, it had made it into a speech by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.“Turning Pepe into a white nationalist icon was one of our original  goals,”  an  anonymous  White  supremacist  on  Twitter  told a reporter for the Daily Beast in 2016. The move to remake Pepe  began  on  /r9k/,  a  4chan  board  where  a  wide  variety  of  users,  including  hackers,  tech  guys  (and  they  were  mostly  guys), libertarians, and White supremacists who migrated from Stormfront  gathered  online.  The  content  at  4chan  is  eclectic,  or, as one writer put it, “a jumble of content, hosting anything from  pictures  of  cute  kittens  to  wildly  disturbing  images  and  language.” It’s also one of the most popular websites ever, with 20 million unique visitors a month, according to founder Chris-topher “Moot” Poole. “We basically mixed Pepe in with Nazi propaganda, etc. We built that association [on 4chan],” a White nationalist  who  goes  by  @JaredTSwift  said.  Once  a  journalist  mentioned the connection on Twitter, White nationalists counted it as a victory—and it was: the mention of the 4chan meme by a “normie” on Twitter was a prank with a big attention payoff. “In a sense, we’ve managed to push white nationalism into a very mainstream position,” @JaredTSwift said. “Now, we’ve pushed the Overton window,” referring to the range of ideas tol-erated in public discourse. Twitter is the key platform for shaping that discourse. “People have adopted our rhetoric, sometimes without even realizing it. We’re setting up for a massive cultural shift,” @JaredTSwift said. Among White supremacists, the think-ing  goes:  if  today  we  can  get  “normies”  talking  about  Pepe  the  Frog,  then  tomorrow  we  can  get  them  to  ask  the  other  questions on our agenda: “Are Jews people?” or “What about black on white crime?” And, when they have a sitting President who will re-tweet accounts that use #whitegenocide hashtags and defend them after a deadly rally, it is fair to say that White supremacists are succeeding at using media and technology to take their message mainstream.networked white rageCNN commentator Van Jones dubbed the 2016 election a “Whitelash,” a very real political backlash by White voters. Across all income levels, White voters (including 53% of White women) preferred the candidate who had retweeted #whitegenocide over the one warning against the alt-right. For many, the uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement coupled with the putative insult of a Black man in the White House were such a threat to personal and national identity that it provoked what Carol Anderson identifies as White Rage.In the span of U.S. racial history, the first  election  of  President  Barack  Obama  was heralded as a high point for so-called American “race relations.” His second term was the apotheosis of this symbolic prog-ress. Some even suggested we were now “post-racial.” But the post-Obama era proves the lie that we were ever post-racial, and it may, when we have the clarity of hindsight, mark the end of an era. If one charts a course from the Civil Rights movement, taking 1954 (Brown v. Board of Education) as a rough starting point and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the close of Obama’s second term as the end point, we might see this as a five-decades-long “second reconstruction” culminating in the 2016 presidential election..  Taking the long view makes the rise of the alt-right look less like a unique eruption and more like a continuation of our national story of systemic racism. Historian Rayford Logan made the  persuasive  argument  that  retrenchment  and  the  brutal  reassertion  of  White  supremacy  through  Jim  Crow  laws  and  the systematic violence of lynching was the White response to “too much” progress by those just a generation from slavery. He called this period, 1877–1920, the “nadir of American race relations.” And the rise of the alt-right may signal the start of Mostly White liberal writers, scholars, and journalists report as if racism is a “bug” rather than a “feature” of the system.65WINTER 2018contextsa second nadir, itself a reaction to progress of Black Americans. The difference this time is that the “Whitelash” is algorithmically amplified, sped up, and circulated through networks to other White ethno-nationalist movements around the world, ignored all the while by a tech industry that “doesn’t see race” in the tools it creates.media, technology, and white nationalismToday, there is a new technological and media paradigm emerging and no one is sure what we will call it. Some refer to it as “the outrage industry,” and others refer to “the mediated construction of reality.” With great respect for these contribu-tions,  neither  term  quite  captures  the  scope  of  what  we  are  witnessing,  especially  when  it  comes  to  the  alt-right.  We  are  certainly no longer in the era of “one-to-many” broadcast dis-tribution, but the power of algorithms and cable news networks to amplify social media conversations suggests that we are no longer in a “peer-to-peer” model either. And very little of our scholarship has caught up in trying to explain the role that “dark money” plays in driving all of this. For example, Rebekah Mer-cer (daughter of hedge-fund billionaire and libertarian Robert Mercer), has been called the “First Lady of the Alt-Right” for her $10-million  underwriting  of  Brietbart  News,  helmed  for  most  of  its  existence  by  former  White  House  Senior  Advisor  Steve  Bannon,  who  called  it  the  “platform  of  the  alt-right.”  White  nationalists have clearly sighted this emerging media paradigm and are seizing—and being provided with millions to help them take  hold  of—opportunities  to  exploit  these  innovations  with  alacrity.  For  their  part,  the  tech  industry  has  done  shockingly  little to stop White nationalists, blinded by their unwillingness to see how the platforms they build are suited for speeding us along to the next genocide.The  second  nadir,  if  that’s  what  this  is,  is  disorienting  because of the swirl of competing articulations of racism across a distracting media ecosystem. Yet, the view that circulates in popular understandings of the alt-right and of tech culture by mostly White liberal writers, scholars, and journalists is one in which racism is a “bug” rather than a “feature” of the system. They report with alarm that there’s racism on the Internet (or, in the last election), as if this is a revelation, or they “journey” into the heart of the racist right, as if it isn’t everywhere in plain sight. Or, they write with a kind of shock mixed with reassurance that alt-right proponents live next door, have gone to college, gotten a proper haircut, look like a hipster, or, sometimes, put on a suit and tie. Our understanding of the algorithmic rise of the alt-right must do better than these quick, hot takes. If we’re to stop the next Charlottesville or the next Emanuel AME Church massacre, we have to recognize that the algorithms of search engines and social media platforms facilitated these hate crimes. To grasp the 21st century world around us involves parsing different inflections of contemporary racism: the overt and ideologically committed White nationalists co-mingle with the tech industry, run by boy-kings steeped in cyberlibertarian notions of freedom, racelessness, and an ethos in which the only evil is restricting the flow of information on the Internet (and, thereby, their profits). In the wake of Charleston and Charlot-tesville, it is becoming harder and harder to sell the idea of an Internet “where there is no race... only minds.” Yet, here we are, locked in this iron cage.recommended resourcesChristopher Bail. 2016.

TITS OR GTFO: THE AGGRESSIVE ARCHITECTURE OF THE INTERNET
ALISON HARVEY / UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER
May 24, 2019 Alison Harvey / University of Leicester One comment
The image of computer scientist Katie Bouman’s joyful expression was circulated widely with the announcement of the first picture produced of a black hole
The image of computer scientist Katie Bouman’s joyful expression was circulated widely with the announcement of the first picture produced of a black hole
The breaking news on April 10, 2019 was the unveiling of the first photo of a black hole ever created, but within a few short days reporting shifted to focus on the consequences of this story for the young female fellow who contributed a significant algorithm to the collaboration. Katie Bouman, who was frequently used as the face of the Event Horizon Telescope project in media stories, took to social media to situate her work within the international scope of the collaboration. Still she became the target of vitriolic sexist and misogynist harassment focused on discrediting and diminishing her input into the project.
As The Guardian article reporting on the attacks notes, such practices are “par for the course for women“, a now-familiar pattern of toxic speech, doxxing, account spamming, and assorted hatred documented across many domains. This includes politics, journalism, and popular culture, and is particularly intense for women of colour. GamerGate, the coordinated campaign of harassment against visible and vocal women, LGBTQ individuals, and people of color in games, was perhaps the moment where these tactics of exclusion garnered mainstream media attention, but as Emma Jane [1] notes there is a long history of incivility online that has not been adequately documented.

This is partly because the mediation of misogyny, racism, and hate is easily dismissed as the work of ‘trolls’, anonymous online entities easily distinguished and distanced from one’s colleagues, friends, and family members. Digital culture scholarship has begun to address the gaps identified by Jane, with researchers including Adrienne Massanari [2] and Caitlin Lawson [3] exploring the persistence and potency of online hate and incivility from the perspective of platform politics. This work draws from Tarleton Gillespie’s [4] foundational intervention into discourses celebrating the neutrality and progressiveness of online intermediaries such as YouTube via recourse to the metaphor of ‘platform’. In tandem with a growing body of research into networked media infrastructures [5], these analyses highlight the importance of considering the interplay of the social and the technical when examining online norms and practices, as networked communication technologies both shape and are shaped by economic and political interests as well as ideological values.
These perspectives are informed by science and technology studies, which provides a critical vocabulary for understanding the politics of technologies that captures the mutually shaping relationship between social actors and technological systems, including within media culture. In ‘Do Artifacts Have Politics?’, Langdon Winner observes that technologies can embody political properties in two ways, as “forms of order” or “inherently political technologies” [6]. Whereas the latter indicates systems ordaining particular political relationships, the former refers to technologies that “favor certain social interests” with “some people…bound to receive a better hand than others” [7]. When the harassment of women, people of colour, and LGBTQ groups online becomes normalized as part of everyday life, it becomes clear that the deck is not stacked in their favour in the design, governance, or regulation of networked media technologies.
Massanari’s research into Reddit and Lawson’s multiplatform analysis indicate that there are designed elements of online spaces enabling the generation and circulation of toxic speech and harassing activity just as much as the celebrated practices of information seeking, community building, and social play. Increasingly, blue-sky perspectives about the promises of digital life are tested by research on in-built technological biases, such as Safiya Noble’s [8] damning revelations of Google’s racist algorithms and Katherine Cross’ [9] work on structures supporting toxicity in online games. In their challenges to long-held notions of freedom, democratization, and progress associated with digital environments, such critiques are met with ferocious defences of freedom of speech in particular. This is but one example of the social norms framing these technologies and practices around them, for as Danielle Citron [10] notes civil rights legislation is an equally applicable legal framework to deal with abuse though is it rarely invoked, to the detriment of women and young people specifically.

When taken on the whole, growing evidence suggests that the designed technological systems and artefacts constituting our digital life serve to discriminate, marginalize, and exclude some publics in an increasingly naturalized but largely invisible fashion. This is neither intended nor deterministic as online feminist and anti-racist activism indicates, and of course the Internet is not the origin or sole site of hate or discrimination in everyday life. However, inattention and indifference to how participation may be inhibited by designed affordances and functionality, likely due to how these interactions are linked to platform profitability, is what makes the Internet’s built environment one that is increasingly an ‘aggressive architecture’.
This concept is derived from critical architecture and urban studies, which tackles those Othered by invisible systems through the rise of what is called ‘defensive’ or ‘hostile’ architecture [11] aimed at discouraging or deterring certain kinds of activity in public spaces. For example, spikes as well as specially designed benches in outdoor spaces are implemented by local councils to deter homeless people from lying down. These forms of silent, repellent design are documented as examples of ‘unpleasant design‘, a moniker indicating how such structural obstructions pervert the ideals of architecture- to design spaces that improve people’s lives. For this reason, it is more accurate to refer to these types of hostile innovations within built environments not as defensive but aggressive, as they invisibly enshrine a desirable public and systematically disadvantage those not valued within this vision.
The Camden Bench is an exemplary case of hostile architecture discouraging a range of behaviours and publics

While it would be fallacious to suggest that an architecture built on open communication is inherently hostile, I argue that ‘active inactivity’ in dealing with toxic and hateful speech and action in the regulation of these sites is what becomes aggressive architecture as the concerns, needs, and well-being of publics continue to go unaddressed despite their visibility. The value of this framing is that it highlights the necessity of social-technical approaches and analysis to account for the political nature of designed spaces of digital life, enabling a broad view of these exclusions as structural, systemic, and interlocking rather than about individual high-profile cases or specific sites.
The expression Tits or GTFO (Get the Fuck Out) likely originated on 4chan in the mid-2000s and became common in a range of imageboards, game communities, and BBS sites as a challenge to the genuineness of female participants in those spaces.

For instance, digital gaming and anti-social networks such as 4chan have long been infamous for incivility towards women, LGBTQ individuals, and people of colour, generating memes such as ‘Tits or GTFO’ that encapsulate how some are not acknowledged as legitimate or credible publics within these spaces. As this kind of harassment, hate, and abuse spreads more broadly across the Internet, socio-technical approaches that tackle the systems and artefacts enabling this become vitally necessary. Fortunately, thinking about aggressive architecture equally affords opportunities for addressing constraints and designing for a more equitable, safe, and inclusive online environment, important and exciting work that has already begun with various projects engaging with the vision of a feminist Internet. Social justice-oriented work into networked technologies, considering the injustices embedded in digital data and design as well as more consentful approaches to technology provide innovative socio-technical approaches to dealing with exploitation and exclusion. Support and adoption of these principles and tactics is urgently needed, and so too is resistance against the growing naturalization of harassment as part and parcel of engaging in everyday life.

Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century (Part One)
October 19, 2006
I spent Thursday in New York speaking on a panel with the University of Chicago's Nicole Pinkard and the University of Southern California's Mimi Ito as part of the public launch of the MacArthur Foundation's exciting slate of new initiatives in the area of youth, learning, and digital media. People interested in understanding the full context of this initiative should keep an eye on the Foundation's new blog. The event was simulcast on Second Life and on Teen Second Life. henry%20in%20second%20life.jpg
This is the context in which we have been pursuing our own Project nml (New Media Literacies) initiatives which I have been discussing from time to time in this blog. The New York City press event was the launching point for a white paper which I wrote for MacArthur identifying what we see as the key social skills and cultural competencies which young people need to be full participants in convergence culture. In Convergence Culture, I devote one chapter to thinking about the impact of participatory culture on our current understandings of education. Here I -- and my collaborators Ravi Purushotma, Margaret Weigel, Katherine Clinton, and Alice J. Robison -- have been able to dig much deeper into the pedagogical implications of the world I discuss in the book as well as to lay out some of the key insights from contemporary research on informal learning, games-based pedagogy, online communities, and participatory culture.
My hope is that this white paper will spark conversations among educators at all levels -- in schools and in after school programs, in public institutions, and in churches and other community centers -- about how we need to change our practices to reflect the new ways that young people are engaging with the world around them.
In hopes of sparking such a conversation, I am publishing the white paper in installments through my blog. This first installment sets the stage, describing some of the challenges and opportunities participatory culture represents in the lives of our young people.
For those of you who are impatient and want to read the whole report at once, you can download it here.
The Needed Skills in the New Media Culture
"If it were possible to define generally the mission of education, it could be said that its fundamental purpose is to ensure that all students benefit from learning in ways that allow them to participate fully in public, community, [Creative] and economic life."
-- New London Group
Ashley Richardson was a middle-schooler when she ran for president of Alphaville. She wanted to control a government that had more than 100 volunteer workers and that made policies that affected thousands of people. She debated her opponent on National Public Radio. She found herself in the center of a debate about the nature of citizenship, about how to ensure honest elections, and about the future of democracy in a digital age. Alphaville is the largest city in the popular multiplayer game, The Sims Online.
Heather Lawver was 14 years old. She wanted to help other young people improve their reading and writing skills. She established an online publication with a staff of more than 100 people across the world. Her project was embraced by teachers and integrated into their curriculum. She emerged as an important spokesperson in a national debate about intellectual property. The website Lawver created was a school newspaper for the fictional Hogwarts, the location for the popular Harry Potter books.
Blake Ross was 14 years old when he was hired for a summer internship at Netscape. By that point, he already had developed computer programming skills and published his own website. Frustrated by many of the corporate decisions made at Netscape, Ross decided to design his own web browser. Through the joint participation of thousands of other volunteer youth and adults working on his project worldwide, the Firefox web browser was born. Today, Firefox enjoys more than 60 times as many users as Netscape Navigator. By age 19, Ross had the venture capital needed to launch his own start-up company. His interest in computing was sparked by playing the popular video game, Sim City.
Josh Meeter was about to graduate from high school when he completed the claymation animation for Awards Showdown, which subsequent was widely circulated on the web. Meeter negotiated with composer John Williams for the rights to use excerpts from his film scores. By networking, he was able to convince Stephen Spielberg to watch the film, and it was later featured on the Spielberg's Dreamworks website. Meeter is now starting work on his first feature film.
Richardson, Lawver, Ross, and Meeter are the future politicians, activists, educators, writers, entrepreneurs, and media makers. The skills they acquired--learning how to campaign and govern; how to read, write, edit, and defend civil liberties; how to program computers and run a business; how to make a movie and get it distributed--are the kinds of skills we might hope our best schools would teach. Yet, none of these activities took place in schools. Indeed, many of these youth were frustrated with school; some dropped out and others chose to graduate early. They developed much of the skill and knowledge through their participation in the informal learning communities of fans and gamers.
Richardson, Lawver, Ross, and Meeter are exceptional individuals. In any given period, exceptional individuals will break all the rules and enjoy off-the-charts success--even at surprisingly young ages. But, Richardson, Lawver, Ross, and Meeter are perhaps less exceptional than one might at first imagine.
According to a 2005 study conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life project, more than one-half of all American teens--and 57 percent of teens who use the Internet--could be considered media creators. For the purpose of the study, a media creator is someone who created a blog or webpage, posted original artwork, photography, stories or videos online or remixed online content into their own new creations. Most have done two or more of these activities. One-third of teens share what they create online with others, 22 percent have their own websites, 19 percent blog, and 19 percent remix online content.
Contrary to popular stereotypes, these activities are not restricted to white suburban males. In fact, urban youth (40 percent) are somewhat more likely than their suburban (28 percent) or rural (38 percent) counterparts to be media creators. Girls aged 15-17 (27 percent) are more likely than boys their age (17 percent) to be involved with blogging or other social activities online. The Pew researchers found no significant differences in participation by race-ethnicity.
If anything, the Pew study undercounts the number of American young people who are embracing the new participatory culture. The Pew study did not consider newer forms of expression, such as podcasting, game modding or machinima. Nor did it count other forms of creative expression and appropriation, such as music sampling in the hip hop community. These forms are highly technological but use other tools and tap other networks for their production and distribution. The study does not include even more widespread practices, such as computer or video gaming, that can require an extensive focus on constructing and performing as fictional personas. Our focus here is not on individual accomplishment but rather the emergence of a cultural context that supports widespread participation in the production and distribution of media.
Enabling Participation
"While to adults the Internet primarily means the world wide web, for children it means email, chat, games-- and here they are already content producers. Too often neglected, except as a source of risk, these communication and entertainment focused activities, by contrast with the information-focused uses at the centre of public and policy agendas, are driving emerging media literacy. Through such uses, children are most engaged-- multi-tasking, becoming proficient at navigation and manoeuvre so as to win, judging their participation and that of others, etc.... In terms of personal development, identity, expression and their social consequences-- participation, social capital, civic culture- these are the activities that serve to network today's younger generation." -- Sonia Livingstone.
Participatory Culture
For the moment, let's define participatory culture as one:
1. With relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement
2. With strong support for creating and sharing one's creations with others
3. With some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices
4. Where members believe that their contributions matter
5. Where members feel some degree of social connection with one another (at the least they care what other people think about what they have created).
Not every member must contribute, but all must believe they are free to contribute when ready and that what they contribute will be appropriately valued.
In such a world, many will only dabble, some will dig deeper, and still others will master the skills that are most valued within the community. The community itself, however, provides strong incentives for creative expression and active participation. Historically, we have valued creative writing or art classes because they help to identify and train future writers and artists, but also because the creative process is valuable on its own; every child deserves the chance to express him- or herself through words, sounds, and images, even if most will never write, perform, or draw professionally. Having these experiences, we believe, changes the way youth think about themselves and alters the way they look at work created by others.
Most public policy discussion of new media have centered on technologies--tools and their affordances. The computer is discussed as a magic black box with the potential to create a learning revolution (in the positive version) or a black hole that consumes resources that might better be devoted to traditional classroom activities (in the more critical version). Yet, as the quote above suggests, media operate in specific cultural and institutional contexts that determine how and why they are used. We may never know whether a tree makes a sound when it falls in a forest with no one around. But clearly, a computer does nothing in the absence of a user. The computer does not operate in a vacuum. Injecting digital technologies into the classroom necessarily affects our relationship with every other communications technology, changing how we feel about what can or should be done with pencils and paper, chalk and blackboard, books, films, and recordings.
Rather than dealing with each technology in isolation, we would do better to take an ecological approach, thinking about the interrelationship among all of these different communication technologies, the cultural communities that grow up around them, and the activities they support. Media systems consist of communication technologies and the social, cultural, legal, political, and economic institutions, practices, and protocols that shape and surround them. The same task can be performed with a range of different technologies, and the same technology can be deployed toward a variety of different ends. Some tasks may be easier with some technologies than with others, and thus the introduction of a new technology may inspire certain uses. Yet, these activities become widespread only if the culture also supports them, if they fill recurring needs at a particular historical juncture. It matters what tools are available to a culture, but it matters more what that culture chooses to do with those tools.
That is why we focus in this paper on the concept of participatory cultures rather than on interactive technologies. Interactivity is a property of the technology, while participation is a property of culture. Participatory culture is emerging as the culture absorbs and responds to the explosion of new media technologies that make it possible for average consumers to archive, annotate, appropriate, and recirculate media content in powerful new ways. A focus on expanding access to new technologies carries us only so far if we do not also foster the skills and cultural knowledge necessary to deploy those tools toward our own ends.
We are using participation as a term that cuts across educational practices, creative processes, community life, and democratic citizenship. Our goals should be to encourage youth to develop the skills, knowledge, ethical frameworks, and self-confidence needed to be full participants in contemporary culture. Many young people are already part of this process through:
Affiliations -- memberships, formal and informal, in online communities centered around various forms of media, such as Friendster, Facebook, message boards, metagaming, game clans, or MySpace).
Expressions -- producing new creative forms, such as digital sampling, skinning and modding, fan videomaking, fan fiction writing, zines, mash-ups).
Collaborative Problem-solving -- working together in teams, formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia, alternative reality gaming, spoiling).
Circulations -- Shaping the flow of media (such as podcasting, blogging)
The MacArthur Foundation has launched an ambitious effort to document these activities and the roles they play in young people's lives. We do not want to preempt or duplicate that effort here. For the moment, it is sufficient to argue that each of these activities contains opportunities for learning, creative expression, civic engagement, political empowerment, and economic advancement.
Through these various forms of participatory culture, young people are acquiring skills that will serve them well in the future. Participatory culture is reworking the rules by which school, cultural expression, civic life, and work operate. A growing body of work has focused on the value of participatory culture and its long-term impact on children's understanding of themselves and the world around them.
Affinity Spaces
Many have argued that these new participatory cultures represent ideal learning environments. James Paul Gee calls such informal learning cultures "affinity spaces," asking why people learn more, participate more actively, engage more deeply with popular culture than they do with the contents of their textbooks. Affinity spaces offer powerful opportunities for learning, Gee argues, because they are sustained by common endeavors that bridge differences in age, class, race, gender, and educational level, and because people can participate in various ways according to their skills and interests, because they depend on peer-to-peer teaching with each participant constantly motivated to acquire new knowledge or refine their existing skills, and because they allow each participant to feel like an expert while tapping the expertise of others. For example, Rebecca Black finds that the "beta-reading" (or editorial feedback) provided by online fan communities helps contributors grow as writers, mastering not only the basic building blocks of sentence construction and narrative structure, but also pushing them to be close readers of the works that inspire them. Participants in the beta-reading process learn both by receiving feedback on their own work and by giving feedback to others, creating an ideal peer-to-peer learning community.
Affinity spaces are distinct from formal educational systems in several ways. While formal education is often conservative, the informal learning within popular culture is often experimental. While formal education is static, the informal learning within popular culture is innovative. The structures that sustain informal learning are more provisional, those supporting formal education are more institutional. Informal learning communities can evolve to respond to short-term needs and temporary interests, whereas the institutions supporting public education have remained little changed despite decades of school reform. Informal learning communities are ad hoc and localized; formal educational communities are bureaucratic and increasingly national in scope. We can move in and out of informal learning communities if they fail to meet our needs; we enjoy no such mobility in our relations to formal education.
Affinity spaces are also highly generative environments, from which new aesthetic experiments and innovations emerge Andrew Blau's 2005 report on The Future of Independent Media argued that this kind of grassroots creativity was an important engine of cultural transformation:
The media landscape will be reshaped by the bottom-up energy of media created by amateurs and hobbyists as a matter of course. This bottom up energy will generate enormous creativity, but it will also tear apart some of the categories that organize the lives and work of media makers...A new generation of media-makers and viewers are emerging which could lead to a sea change in how media is made and consumed.
Blau's report celebrates a world in which everyone has access to the means of creative expression and the networks supporting artistic distribution. The Pew study suggests something more: young people who create and circulate their own media are more likely to respect the intellectual property rights of others because they feel a greater stake in the cultural economy. Both reports suggest we are moving away from a world in which some produce and many consume media, toward one in which everyone has a more active stake in the culture that is produced.
David Buckingham argues that young people's lack of interest in news and their disconnection from politics reflects their perception of disempowerment.
"By and large, young people are not defined by society as political subjects, let alone as political agents. Even in the areas of social life that affect and concern them to a much greater extent than adults--most notably education--political debate is conducted almost entirely 'over their heads'"
Politics, as constructed by the news, becomes a spectator sport, something we watch but do not do. Yet, the new participatory culture offers many opportunities for youth to engage in civic debates, to participate in community life, to become political leaders, even if sometimes only through the "second lives" offered by massively multiplayer games or online fan communities.
Empowerment comes from making meaningful decisions within a real civic context: we learn the skills of citizenship by becoming political actors and gradually coming to understand the choices we make in political terms. Today's children learn through play the skills they will apply to more serious tasks later. The challenge is how to connect decisions in the context of our everyday lives with the decisions made at local, state, or national levels. The step from watching television news and acting politically seems greater than the transition from being a political actor in a game world to acting politically in the "real world."
Participating in these affinity spaces also has economic implications. We suspect that young people who spend more time playing within these new media environments will feel greater comfort interacting with one another via electronic channels, will have greater fluidity in navigating information landscapes, will be better able to multitask and make rapid decisions about the quality of information they are receiving, and will be able to collaborate better with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. These claims are borne out by research conducted by Beck and Wade into the ways that early game play experiences affect subsequent work habits and professional activities. Beck and Wade conclude that gamers were more open to taking risks and engaging in competition but also more open to collaborating with others and more willing to revise earlier assumptions.
This focus on the value of participating within the new media culture stands in striking contrast to recent reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation that have bemoaned the amount of time young people spend on "screen media." The Kaiser reports collapse a range of different media consumption and production activities into the general category of "screen time" without reflecting very deeply on the different degrees of social connectivity, creativity, and learning involved. We do not mean to dismiss the very real concerns they raise: that mediated experience may squeeze out time for other learning activities; that contemporary children often lack access to real world play spaces, with adverse health consequences, that adults may inadequately supervise and interact with children about the media they consume (and produce); or concerns about the moral values and commercialization in much contemporary entertainment. Yet, the focus on negative effects of media consumption offers an incomplete picture. These accounts do not appropriately value the skills and knowledge young people are gaining through their involvement with new media, and as a consequence, they may mislead us about the roles teachers and parents should play in helping children learn and grow.

var x = (function IIFE(){
return 42;
})();
x; // 42
The 42 value gets returned from the IIFE-named function being
executed, and is then assigned to x.
Closure
Closure is one of the most important, and often least understood,
concepts in JavaScript. I won’t cover it in deep detail here, and
instead refer you to the Scope & Closures title of this series. But I
want to say a few things about it so you understand the general con‐
cept. It will be one of the most important techniques in your JS skill‐
set.
You can think of closure as a way to “remember” and continue to
access a function’s scope (its variables) even once the function has
finished running.
Consider:
function makeAdder(x) {
// parameter `x` is an inner variable
// inner function `add()` uses `x`, so
// it has a "closure" over it
function add(y) {
return y + x;
};
return add;
}
The reference to the inner add(..) function that gets returned with
each call to the outer makeAdder(..) is able to remember whatever x
value was passed in to makeAdder(..). Now, let’s use makeAd
der(..):
// `plusOne` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
// function with closure over the `x` parameter of
// the outer `makeAdder(..)`
var plusOne = makeAdder( 1 );
// `plusTen` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
// function with closure over the `x` parameter of
// the outer `makeAdder(..)`
Functions as Values | 49
performance optimizations with the new syntax. This also lets
browser makers have more real-world code to test their imple‐
mentations and optimizations on.
• Using the new syntax earlier allows it to be tested more robustly
in the real world, which provides earlier feedback to the Java‐
Script committee (TC39). If issues are found early enough, they
can be changed/fixed before those language design mistakes
become permanent.
Here’s a quick example of transpiling. ES6 adds a feature called
“default parameter values.” It looks like this:
function foo(a = 2) {
console.log( a );
}
foo(); // 2
foo( 42 ); // 42
Simple, right? Helpful, too! But it’s new syntax that’s invalid in pre-
ES6 engines. So what will a transpiler do with that code to make it
run in older environments?
function foo() {
var a = arguments[0] !== (void 0) ? arguments[0] : 2;
console.log( a );
}
As you can see, it checks to see if the arguments[0] value is void 0
(aka undefined), and if so provides the 2 default value; otherwise, it
assigns whatever was passed.
In addition to being able to now use the nicer syntax even in older
browsers, looking at the transpiled code actually explains the
intended behavior more clearly.
You may not have realized just from looking at the ES6 version that
undefined is the only value that can’t get explicitly passed in for a
default-value parameter, but the transpiled code makes that much
more clear.
The last important detail to emphasize about transpilers is that they
should now be thought of as a standard part of the JS development
ecosystem and process. JS is going to continue to evolve, much more
quickly than before, so every few months new syntax and new fea‐
tures will be added.
Old & New | 57
almost a metaphor for the spirit of this series, to embrace that we’ll
never fully know every part of JS, because as soon as you master it
all, there’s going to be new stuff coming down the line that you’ll
need to learn.
This title is dedicated to both the short- and mid-term visions of
where the language is headed, not just the known stuff like ES6 but
the likely stuff beyond.
While all the titles of this series embrace the state of JavaScript at the
time of this writing, which is midway through ES6 adoption, the pri‐
mary focus in the series has been more on ES5. Now, we want to
turn our attention to ES6, ES7, and beyond...
Since ES6 is nearly complete at the time of this writing, ES6 &
Beyond starts by dividing up the concrete stuff from the ES6 land‐
scape into several key categories, including new syntax, new data
structures (collections), and new processing capabilities and APIs.
We cover each of these new ES6 features, in varying levels of detail,
including reviewing details that are touched on in other books of
this series.
Some exciting ES6 things to look forward to reading about: destruc‐
turing, default parameter values, symbols, concise methods, compu‐
ted properties, arrow functions, block scoping, promises, generators,
iterators, modules, proxies, weakmaps, and much, much more!
Phew, ES6 packs quite a punch!
The first part of the book is a roadmap for all the stuff you need to
learn to get ready for the new and improved JavaScript you’ll be
writing and exploring over the next couple of years.
The latter part of the book turns attention to briefly glance at things
that we can likely expect to see in the near future of JavaScript. The
most important realization here is that post-ES6, JS is likely going to
evolve feature by feature rather than version by version, which
means we can expect to see these near-future things coming much
sooner than you might imagine.
The future for JavaScript is bright. Isn’t it time we start learning it?

Objective
"This project responds to the ICT-35-2016 Enabling responsible ICT-related research and innovation, topic B, and will ""reflect and challenge the way ICT-related research and innovation is currently approached."" The computerization of society in the late 1970s has now reached a point where the global economy works through an algorithmic networked environment. This situation is addressed in this research as an algorithmic condition. Any form of ICT operates within this condition. The question is, what are the ethical codes and guidelines that guide research within this condition? The Ethics of Coding prepares research that will provide an indexical report on the conceptual and thematic issues of ICT- related research and innovation, which will suggest what an ethics for ICT related issues could be, and how that might be implemented in relation to actualized and possible ICT projects. In addition, the research addresses the extent to which the coding of the social, ethical, and pedagogic, is always already invested in the maintenance of power relations that control the economic conditions for knowledge (which regulate the global markets) with what Wendy Chun (2011) describes as a ""code logos."" Working with the Philosopher of the human condition of the twentieth century; Hannah Arendt (1958; 1978), an inter-disciplinary think-tank research team brings Arendtian ethical philosophy into dialogue with SSH experts from a number of disciplinary fields, including thinkers of technologies and their effects on societies, philosophers of mathematics, gender and humanities experts, educational philosophy specialists, digital media thinkers, to produce a report that reflects the expression of the human algorithmic condition. The project is committed to engaging with a broad range of stakeholders to substantiate its approach and the resources requested include a substantial budget to facilitate the participation of external experts in the EoC colloquia and the final project event."

By Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein

A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.
Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.
Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”
Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.

Introduction: Why Data Science Needs Feminism
1. The Power Chapter
Principle #1 of Data Feminism is to Examine Power. Data feminism begins by analyzing how power operates in the world.
2. Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach
Principle #2 of Data Feminism is to Challenge Power. Data feminism commits to challenging unequal power structures and working toward justice.
3. On Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints
Principle #3 of Data Feminism is to Elevate Emotion and Embodiment. Data feminism teaches us to value multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.
4. “What Gets Counted Counts”
Principle #4 of Data Feminism is to Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies. Data feminism requires us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting and classification that perpetuate oppression.
5. Unicorns, Janitors, Ninjas, Wizards, and Rock Stars
Principle #5 of Data Feminism is to Embrace Pluralism. Data feminism insists that the most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives, with priority given to local, Indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing.
6. The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves
Principle #6 of Data Feminism is to Consider Context. Data feminism asserts that data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis.
7. Show Your Work
Principle #7 of Data Feminism is to Make Labor Visible. The work of data science, like all work in the world, is the work of many hands. Data feminism makes this labor visible so that it can be recognized and valued.

Introduction
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops international Web standards: HTML, CSS, and many more. W3C’s Web standards are called W3C Recommendations.
All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group.
The W3C standards and Working Group Notes introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility.
Accessibility Guidelines
Essential Components of Web Accessibility shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, and how the WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) apply.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2
Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:
    natural information such as text, images, and sounds
    code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.
WCAG applies to dynamic content, multimedia, “mobile”, etc. WCAG can also be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), as described in WCAG2ICT.

    What’s New in WCAG 2.2 Draft
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)
Authoring tools are software and services that “authors” (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. For example: HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), and websites that let users add content, such as blogs and social networking sites. ATAG documents explain how to:
    make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and
    help authors create more accessible web content.

W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 Working Draft
WCAG 3 is an early draft that is intended to become a W3C Standard. WCAG 3 applies to web content, apps, tools, publishing, and emerging technologies on the web.
WCAG 3 info:
    WCAG 3 Introduction
Technical Specifications
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
ARIA provides semantics so authors can convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). The ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements.
The ARIA suite includes API mapping specifications that provide user agent implementation guidance. It also include modules for Graphics and Digital Publishing.
ARIA info:
    WAI-ARIA Overview – includes a list and description of modules and API mappings
    WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
    WAI-ARIA 1.1 Standard
Audio and Video
    WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format is a format for captions, text video descriptions, and other metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.
    Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) is intended to be used for transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats for subtitling and captioning.
Evaluation
The following resources support development of accessibility evaluation methods and tools:
    Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Overview — ACT establishes and documents rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards. The WCAG 2 Test Rules use the ACT rules format.
    Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview — EARL is a machine-readable format for expressing test results.
Additional resources related to evaluation are listed in the Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview, including:
    WCAG-EM Overview: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology — WCAG-EM is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
WAI-Adapt
WAI-Adapt Overview — WAI-Adapt enables users to adapt (or ‘personalize’) how content is presented to meet their needs and preferences. Content authors can use WAI-Adapt standards to provide a default design and enable user adaptation with minimal work.
Pronunciation
Pronunciation Overview — Pronunciation is about screen readers and other text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis pronouncing content properly.

ABSTRACT
As our technologies travel to new cultural contexts and our
designs and methods engage new constituencies, both our
design and analytical practices face significant challenges.
We offer postcolonial computing as an analytical
orientation to better understand these challenges. This
analytic orientation inspires four key shifts in our approach
to HCI4D efforts: generative models of culture,
development as a historical program, uneven economic
relations, and cultural epistemologies. Then, through
reconsideration of the practices of engagement, articulation
and translation in other contexts, we offer designers and
researchers ways of understanding use and design practice
to respond to global connectivity and movement.

INTRODUCTION
Technology travels. It moves around the world in projects
of design and development. Design practice, similarly,
spans continents, both in large-scale processes of
transnational production and in the smaller, local practices
by which technologies are understood and put to use in
different settings. In recent years, HCI has become
especially interested in opportunities surrounding cross-
cultural design practice, with a special focus on HCI design
for “the developing world” (HCI4D). Research in HCI4D
has struggled with a range of complex problems –
technological cultures, digital divides, multiple
stakeholders, economic disparities, and more.
In this paper, we examine a series of concerns that are latent
within much research conducted under the umbrella of
HCI4D. We take as our starting point a move from
“development” discourse to postcolonial discourse – that is,
a discourse centered on the questions of power, authority,
legitimacy, participation, and intelligibility in the contexts
of cultural encounter, particularly in the context of
contemporary globalization. Our first goal is to outline the
alternative perspective on HCI4D that we can gain by
looking to the lessons from related disciplines, most
particularly Science and Technology Studies (STS) and
postcolonial studies; we do this with four cases drawn from
the revealing fringes of design-related fieldwork and
history. Our second goal is to show how we might
reconfigure design-oriented cultural encounters in this light.
We label this shift in perspective with the term
“postcolonial computing.”
What is “Postcolonial” Computing?
Formulating the term, we take inspiration from the
articulation of new visions for HCI in programs such as
“mobile computing,” “service-oriented computing,” “urban
computing,” and “ubiquitous computing.” These areas,
however, mark application areas and new forms of
technology. Postcolonial computing is not a new domain or
design space, but an alternative sensibility to the process of
design and analysis. It asserts a series of questions and
concerns inspired by the conditions of postcoloniality but
relevant to any design project – most particularly those in
HCI4D contexts, but in other contexts too.
When we speak of a “postcolonial” approach, we are not
simply focused on the historical conditions of nations and
regions that were once colonies. Postcolonial studies began
with such investigations, but rapidly came to understand
that its topic was actually the historical transformation of
conditions of cultural encounter. Colonial relationships
may have dissolved, and yet the history of global dynamics
of power, wealth, economic strength, and political influence
shape contemporary cultural encounters. For example,
lower cost labor and mineral extraction in Asia and Africa
tacitly undergirds the development of cheaper, faster, and
smaller computers used and sold globally. Colonial tropes
characterizing certain people as in need of enlightenment,

civilization, and development still persist today. These
postcolonial conditions affect China and Sweden as much
as they do India, Britain, Australia, or Kenya. We all live in
a world shaped by colonial histories; we all find ourselves
in postcolonial conditions.
Postcolonial theory has most powerfully demonstrated the
ways projects we engage in for “others” often tell us more
about ourselves. Postcolonial computing, then, is not a
project of making better design for “other” cultures or
places. It is a project of understanding how all design
research and practice is culturally located and power laden,
even if considered fairly general. This specificity is not a
problem to be solved, but a reality that should be central to
design practice – seeing the ways that design is culturally
specific should allow us to broaden the conversation about
what other practices can count as good design.
Postcolonial computing is a shift in perspective motivated
by the challenges and problems of transferring of
technological knowledge, particularly in ICT4D and the
HCI questions it inspires.
THORNY ISSUES IN ICT4D
ICT4D designers face challenges transporting both design
conventions and processes of HCI across cultures. HCI’s
visual conventions have proven not to be universal –
systems effective in the US may fail utterly in Japan or
South Africa. For example, design aesthetics vary wildly
from place to place [21] and taken-for-granted symbolic
literacies, such as recognizing an image representing a GUI
button, are strange in less computer-saturated cultures [23].
The processes of designing and deploying HCI4D across
cultures have proven challenging as well. Researchers
designing for resource-poor but socially interconnected
contexts have proposed shifting from user-centered design
to “communitization” or community-centric design (e.g.
[24]). Community engagement has become important in
requirements elicitation and co-design (e.g. [8,24,28]), as
well as making deployments sustainable [5]. The very
different social, cultural, infrastructural, and economic
situations of HCI4D have required researchers to
substantially adapt HCI methods and practices.
Hardware and connectivity have also produced instructive
case studies of technological failure in international
encounters. Take, for example, the simple matter of a
lightbulb that traveled from Europe to Africa [2]. The
lightbulb’s European designers tightly integrated its
components, hiding the technology in order to user-proof it.
When the lightbulb required adaptation to reach power
sources far away from the room to be lit, the bulb proved
impossible to hack or adapt. The notion of a hermetically
sealed, all-in-one, “plug-and-play” design – seemingly
perfectly adapted to an environment without an extensive
technological infrastructure – turned out, in fact, to render it
useless in the face of local contingencies. Many such well-
intentioned efforts to “migrate” technologies from
industrialized contexts to other parts of the world have
foundered either on infrastructural differences or on social,
cultural, political, or economic assumptions that do not
hold. Such failures of technology transfer led to the rise of
the “Appropriate Technology” (AT) movement in the 1970s
and 1980s [31]. AT focused on fitness for purpose, arguing
that smaller technologies that accounted for local needs,
infrastructures, skills, and materials would be more
effective than large-scale engineering efforts. These
principles, of course, are also central to user-centered
design, and so the emergence of HCI4D as a user-centered
design perspective on cross-cultural development is an
unsurprising development.
Some have sought to predict and understand these problems
of translating HCI knowledge by drawing on taxonomic
models of culture where members of cultural groups are
characterized by traits and averages (e.g. [19]). This model
has been used to explain conflict in organizations,
communication dynamics, and even choices in website
design. However, the assumption that individuals have a
single cultural background is problematic, especially in the
face of contemporary patterns of globalization and
transnationalisms. These models, as Marsden argues [24],
are also of limited help in design because they describe
average tendencies but provide little insight into any
particular person’s cultural experience.
If these models are misleading, then what can we turn to as
a resource for research and design practice? We argue that
STS and postcolonial studies provide understandings of
cultural entanglement and colonial discourses that help us
better understand complex issues of intercultural
engagement around technology design in HCI4D. In the
following section, we illustrate this through explorations of
four connected cases: first, the rhetoric of cultural
differences; second, the problematic rhetoric and practice of
“development”; third, the globalized pattern of economic
relations within which these efforts are embedded; and
fourth, cultural conceptions of knowledge. We then turn to
implications for design practices and methodologies arising
from this analytical turn.
CASE STUDIES
The following cases are drawn from our fieldwork and from
histories of technological travel. These are stories of
connection: of researcher to culturally different users, of
rural Indians to transnational NGOs, of Brazilian engineers
to Apple, and of aboriginal Australians to California. We
examine these mundane experiences in globalized
technology design through the lens of postcolonial
computing.
Reassessing “Culture” Difference
We begin with a case drawn on a research project
conducted by one of us as part of a corporate internship.
The design brief given by the large multinational
corporation hosting my summer internship was clear: the
company was developing a sensor network for the elderly
so that they could remain independent in their homes as
they aged, and wanted to examine the opportunities for
releasing this product in international markets. The target
groups were the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and
China), united by their economic status on a global
measurement scale rather than by any cultural similarities.
With little money available for travel, I trekked out into the
mid-sized American town and its suburbs to conduct my
research. There, among immigrant populations, I was told,
I would find examples of these different national cultures,
and could find out from there how their culture conceived
of issues of health and aging.
This design brief may sound familiar to many readers, as
may the conflicts that followed in the ensuing research. The
researcher encountered families that called themselves
“American” in some contexts and “foreign” in others.
These families’ practices bridged communities between
their US locality and international networks, employing a
variety of technical and social resources for what they were,
what they valued, and what they did. Such language
disconnected with the design brief, wherein culture was
taxonomized, reified, and employed as a static
denomination to distinguish between user groups and
communities. This view of culture is quite common as a
way of classifying people, activities, and settings – “Latin”
versus “Asian” cultures, for instance – in terms of
systematic difference between groups. This sense of culture
taxonomized people along lines that might be figured as
geographical, in the sense of regions or nation states, or
collective, as in subcultures, diasporas, or organizations.
These taxonomic views invoke the idea of two bounded
spaces: “here” and “there,” where “there” is other, apart,
and disconnected, stably distanced from “here.” They
invoke “other-ness” and, tacitly, a universal “self” who can
observe and mark the difference. Even within the “here”-
ness of the American town that was the researcher’s field
site, the researcher was promised to encounter an “other”
“out there” – someone with a different, disconnected, and
static method of categorizing and making sense of the
world.
The promise of generalizability along familiar scales such
as the nation-state has made Hall’s [17] and Hofstede’s [19]
frameworks popular in organizational behavior and social
informatics. The taxonomic view, however, suffers from a
range of problems. Studies have found such dimensions
analytically weak in explaining conflicts [10] and
differences in technology use [12], while HCI researchers
have argued that cultural “averages” are of limited use for
design [24]. More problematically, the taxonomic view of
culture is both historically and ontologically suspect.
Cultural categories are frequently rooted in geographical
separation, but technologically enabled interactions, such as
internet communities, mobile technologies, and remote
collaboration, call into question where one cultural zone
ends and the next one begins. These technologies of
communication and mobility circulate cultural concepts
globally ([3,22]) as a condition of contemporary (and not-
so-contemporary) living. At what scale should we see
culture – the nation, the region, the city, the town? With
respect to the “Asian”, “European” and “Latino” families
encountered in this fieldwork, where does the “home
culture” end and the “American culture” start?
A more productive analytical position here, we argue, a
“generative” view of culture arising from contemporary
anthropology and postcolonial studies. Here, culture is a
lens through which people collectively encounter the world
– a system of interpretive signification through which the
world inter-subjectively meaningful. From this view, an
individual may participate in many cultures – cultures of
ethnicity, nationhood, profession, class, gender, kinship,
and history – each of which, with its logics and narratives,
frames the experience of everyday life. Rather than
classifying people on various cultural dimensions, a
generative view of culture suggests we ask how the
technological objects and knowledge practices of everyday
life become meaningful contingently and dynamically as
social activity unfolds. In this sense, culture shapes
experience but is in turn reproduced and generated through
everyday interaction.
Indeed, taking culture as something that is dynamic,
collectively produced, and enacted in everyday encounters
problematizes taxonomic models that see culture as
acquired and internal to the individual – “software for the
mind” shared by people of the same nation [19]. This shift
of perspective is especially important in the context of HCI,
as understanding transformations effected in part by
technology design requires an understanding of cultural
change as much as cultural stabilities. Hofstede’s popular
framework, after all, provides a snapshot of traits at a single
point in time. It has little to say, then, about the norm-
shifting of technologies, social movements, or even
everyday reconfigurations of practice around technology,
media, artifacts or experience. Yet it is precisely those
changing cultural practices that designers aspire to support
and in which they wish to intervene when they introduce a
system into a setting. For example, HCI4D projects might
use technology to make microlending more efficient,
accountable, and far reaching (e.g. [26]). Such interventions
begin in conversation with existing practices, but also
reconfigure local power relations within villages and
households [16]. These reconfigurations can shift the
interpretive frames of diverse aspects of everyday life,
including technology, financial practice, commercial
activity, and gender relations. Understanding how
technology design is adopted, learned, and used, then,
requires a dynamic model of culture.
We do not present this case to suggest that studies of
diasporic communities can substitute for studies of cultures
in a pure or home context. Rather, the diaspora case
illuminates the fluidity of cultural, regional, and
transnational boundaries, as well as the variability of the
what “home culture” can mean in daily life. People relate
variably to a range of local and international networks,
producing their cultural identities through a variety of
signifying practices [20]. If it seems that Indonesians, say,
share common frames in how they intersubjectively
interpret the world, it is a phenomenon in need of
explanation. The same may not be true of all nations.
Consistent with these dynamic processes by which cultural
identities and practice are formed, the generative view of
culture suggested by the postcolonial perspective allows
designers to recognize their work not as designing
appropriately for static, nationally-bound cultures, but
instead as interventions both in conversation with and
transformative of existing cultural practices.
The Problem of Development
Our second case is drawn from an initial ethnographic
engagement that forms part of a larger, ongoing project.
D-Design, an Indian design consultancy, had been
commissioned by health care NGO HealthWorks to
complete a home placement study of prototype household
water filters. The client was a reputable non-governmental
organization focused on development. HealthWorks sought
to develop a commercial market for water filters among
Indians living in poverty as a means of curbing water-borne
illness. The imagined study recruit, according to the lead
designer, was “fairly poor,” getting “water from the dirty
river,” often ill from water-borne illness, and without a
filter.
D-Design’s team drove hundreds of kilometers from village
to village searching for participants for the study but found
few people who matched the client’s image of poverty. What
the design researchers found instead were villages where
people seemed relatively happy or even proud of their
water. Few complained about water-related illness, though
many complained about health problems from over-
fluoridated water from wells – a problem that the prototype
water filters would not remedy and HealthWorks chose not
to pursue. “Where is the poverty?!” cried one of the
designers at a team debriefing following village visits,
throwing his hands up before dramatically throwing his
head onto the table. Failing to find the imagined targets of
development in the field, the team loosened their image of
the ideal participant, finding people who were curious
enough about the filter and met loosened income
requirements.
By seeing this case through the analytical lens of
postcolonial computing, several issues in contemporary
development are foregrounded: the discourse of global,
technical solutions to problems; the alignment of
development projects with the interests of commercial
actors in industrialized countries; the directionality of
product and monetary flows in development programs; and
disempowerment through consumer-oriented development.
Development here encompasses a range of programs for
financial and technological assistance set up between
“advanced” and “developing” countries, or among more
complex financial arrangements between governments,
NGOs, philanthropists, corporations, and supranational
institutions such as the World Bank.
The discourse of global, technical solutions to problems of
development is critical to understanding why HealthWorks
chose not to pursue the problem of over-fluoridation
identified through early stage design research. This may
seem to fly in the face of user-centered design, which
prescribes designing around target users’ needs. The
project, instead, is a solution in search of users – users
found through great expenditure of time and energy.
HealthWorks’ reluctance to change course stems from the
wide availability of low-cost bacterial filtering technology
designed for wealthier markets. HealthWorks, by their own
description, adapts existing technologies in rich countries so
they work in poor ones. Designing a fluoride filter would
require a longer design and research cycle for a less
universal-seeming problem. By contrast to the NGO’s
design-centered efforts, local Indian activists have been
mobilizing for a public-sector, political and infrastructural
solution to the fluoride problem. Ferguson’s analysis of
NGOs and development in Lesotho [13] suggest that
HealthWorks’ global framing is characteristic of
development more broadly; development regimes in recent
decades, he argues, have systematically avoided
confronting the actions of large-scale actors such as
governments and corporations as causes of the socio-
economic conditions they seek to remedy, instead seeking
behavioral, educational, and market-based solutions at the
local level. Some see NGO’s focus on the local as an
advantage, keeping NGOs far from the taint of the politics
[15] of governments that have been painted as corrupt. This
NGO avoidance of politics, Ferguson argues, depoliticize
poverty by covering the sometimes highly political causes
of poverty: “By uncompromisingly reducing poverty to a
technical problem, and by promising technical solutions to
the sufferings of powerless and oppressed people, the
hegemonic problematic of ‘development’ is the principle
means through which the question of poverty is de-
politicized in the world today” [13:256]. In Lesotho,
Ferguson’s example, World Bank reports recommended
agricultural technology as a remedy for farmers who had
lost their arable land to Dutch settlers. These approaches
fail to discern the importance of political causes and
political solutions to problems of poverty, leaving many
failed development projects in their wake.
This leads to a second critique: development regimes have
historically been aligned with the interests of politically
powerful commercial and capital market actors.
HealthWorks is well known as an early advocate of public-
private partnerships in the development and distribution of
health products. In its project with D-Design, HealthWorks
sought not only to develop a usable, useful water filter but
also to develop distribution networks to retail the filter
through rural and slum businesses. In aligning diverse
actors to enable the distribution of water filters,
HealthWorks’ interests are aligned with corporations like
Pepsi who have similarly developed retail channels among
India’s poor. These alignments can take diverse forms at
different times and places. In opening developing
economies to Western investment as a loan condition,
World Bank policies destabilized many economies by
exposing them to speculation or predatory corporate
interest. In some cases, these interests have not run parallel
to those of stable state development. In his study of
extractive industries in Africa, Ferguson [14] notes that
while opening African nations up to Western investment in
the 1990s had been proposed as a way of incorporating
African nations into the global economy and providing
them with the resources to grow both economic and civic
infrastructure, foreign investment actually fared best in
countries that were anti-democratic or even in a state of
civil war. Highly-technologized mineral extraction
industries reaped profits by avoiding African nations with
strong unions and democratic traditions as they would
impede extraction operations. The potential consequences
of bringing resources and people in line with the interests of
powerful capital and commercial actors is rarely recognized
and analyzed in ICT4D literatures.
Third, the flow of technologies from HealthWorks, an
American NGO, to development targets around the world
parallels the structural flows of goods and money in
colonial relations. The economic ties are quite complex.
HealthWorks partners with private entities, sometimes local
distributors or manufacturers and at other times
multinational consumer goods corporations, to develop and
distribute health products. As a prominent, well-funded
NGO with connections to powerful actors, however,
HealthWorks exerts considerable strategic control over the
shape of projects and deployments by channeling money in
ways that funders in highly industrialized countries find
compelling. These flows, Escobar argues [11], of capital
and strategic control characterize development more
broadly. Escobar analyzes the history of development
efforts in the second half of the twentieth century,
observing that development typically follows patterns based
broadly on colonial histories. The economics of colonialism
were frequently based on the movement of raw materials
from colonies to colonial centers, and the movement of
finished products in the opposite direction. The movements
of goods in development relationships are often much the
same.
Fourth, HealthWorks’ local, individually-focused strategy
attempts to build a market of consumers – a strategy that
some argue is inherently disempowering. Escobar argues
that development programs have historically pursued
progress by figuring people as consumers of technology
designed and manufactured elsewhere. These technologies
historically have included laptops made in Taiwan [6],
fertilizers engineered in the US [16], or even water filters.
In Escobar’s analysis, the rhetoric and practice of
development positions emerging nations as essentially
powerless and unable to “develop” without intervention.
The provision of goods and services then positions these
nations as consumers of Western technologies and services.
The kinds of infrastructure investments that are often
associated with development efforts ensure “lock-in” to the
goods and services provided by Western corporations. This
was an explicit goal of the US Marshall Plan for aid to
Western Europe after the Second World War, which sought
to rebuild the economies of European nations in order to
ensure a ready market for American products [30]. The
Marshall Plan set the context for further development
programs, which share both the ideological commitment
and the practical consequence of creating new markets and
new consumers. These framings do not necessarily effect
disempowerment, but they make uneven relations of
economic dependency possible. These problems complicate
HCI4D projects that seek to help integrate people into
markets, whether as producers or consumers, as a means of
empowerment.
Uneven Economic Relations
No design practice takes place outside of a series of
economic conditions that make it possible. In the case that
follows, uneven economic relations, with consequences for
legal and cultural power, shape what counts as legitimate
design practice.
As Brazil sought to develop its economy during the 1970s
and 1980s, its government provided incentives to
companies that designed and manufactured products within
Brazil as a means of eliminating poverty and encouraging
indigenous innovation. Unitron, a Brazilian company,
responded by reverse engineering, designing, and
manufacturing a Mac compatible machine called “Mac de
periferia” (Mac of the Periphery). Though Apple had no
intellectual property protection for the Macintosh in Brazil,
the American corporation was able to pressure government
and other economic actors within Brazil to reframe
Unitron’s activities, once seen as nationalist and anti-
colonial, as immoral piracy. In exerting political pressure
through its economic strength, Apple was able to reshape
notions of authorship to exclude reverse engineering and
modification, realigning Brazilian notions of intellectual
authorship with American notions that privilege the
originator over maintainers and modifiers of code and
hardware architecture [9]. These economically motivated
legal actions shaped definitions of what counts as
legitimate design work, innovation, and creativity –
concepts often taken for granted in HCI research.
Notably, in this case, Unitron’s design process had value
beyond the technology that it produced, or in this case
reproduced. The very process of creating the Mac of the
periphery was meaningful as a claim of indigenous
technological capability in reverse engineering, as a symbol
of local manufacture, and as a way of signaling national
independence. This suggests that as design methods travel
practices that we see at work in different specific sites of
technology design and use, while at the same time
recognizing the ways that those localisms are conditioned
and embedded within global and historical flows of
material, people, capital, knowledge, and technology. The
postcolonial computing lens focuses our attention, then, on
the translations, dependencies, conditions, and histories that
shape perceptions of technology and its opportunities. This
change in approach inspired by postcolonial and STS work
provoked us as designers to revisit our design toolkit with
an eye towards international settings.
This reframing also invites us to reconsider design methods
and design practice. Traditional design processes, in HCI as
well as related disciplines, break down into a familiar range
of steps and procedures, from the identification of potential
user communities, the analysis of their activities, the
formulation of design requirements, ideation and iteration,
and so forth. We suggest an alternate formulation of design
work – engagement, articulation, and translation. This
formulation broadens notions of what counts as design
work and suggests an alternate sensibility for evaluating
such work.
By “engagement” we mean connecting with users or an
application domain in order to understand relevant work or
activity; since HCI design is primarily “user-centered,” this
is most commonly (although not always) a form of
engagement with people and their material worlds.
“Articulation” concerns how properties of this domain are
formalized and transformed into a series of requirements for
technological support. Finally, “translation” concerns how
these requirements, possibly through a series of steps, are
transformed from statements about a domain to statements
about technology and eventually into specific pieces of
technology designed to support the application domain.
By abstracting design methods into these aspects, we gain
analytical purchase over HCI design practices. Our
motivation for introducing these facets is to take traditional
elements of the design process, such as requirements
capture or workflow analysis, and place them in a context
that makes clear relevance of issues of power, history, and
epistemology. We will discuss each one in turn, and show
the relevance of a postcolonial approach.
Engagement
Postcolonial computing points to the many ways histories,
power relations, and epistemology tacitly underpin
engagements in design, offering HCI researchers and
practitioners new lines of inquiry. Design often involves
transcultural encounters, between designers and users,
designers and engineers, between corporate- and non-
corporate actors, or even between differently located actors
working collaboratively to design for themselves or for one
another. In this view, observing users, eliciting
requirements, and deploying technologies are only some of
the sorts of encounters that can animate HCI research.
Engagements in design methods can take many forms,
including design research, technology deployment,
feedback, and maintenance. In usability testing, people
serve as model users in a usability lab setting, directed by a
usability researcher to test software in front of two-way
mirror. The encounter within the laboratory walls is
described as data, often observed by unseen others behind a
one-way mirror or on video. Whether or not this form of
engagement is scientific or objective is less interesting for
our purposes than the way the engagement has been shaped
by scientific roles and discourses, lending authority both
between researcher and model user, and between researcher
and consumer of the research findings. The authority of
this method benefits from the ways scientific ways of
knowing have been elevated above other forms of
knowledge creation in some settings [1]. In other settings,
however, the context in which usability studies work may
not be present. For example, histories of exploitation by
researchers or a distrust of disengaged observers make such
methods untenable in some communities [4].
Another Western design method, Participatory Design
(PD), draws authority from a very different set of
discourses of labor relations and social justice. Developed
primarily in Scandinavia but taken up more broadly, PD
maintains roles for designers and users but calls for users to
participate in the imagination and specification of work
technologies. The modes of engagement, deliberation, and
negotiation are drawn from Scandinavia’s strong traditions
of union involvement in workplace decision-making [36]. It
is not that PD works because of an inherent superiority to
other methods. It works (when it works) because it takes
advantage of cultural logics and practices particular to the
location in which it emerged. Researchers have long
grappled with how to generalize and adapt PD to enable
participation by non-organized workforces and have noted
the particular challenges of reproducing PD engagements in
different national and political cultures [25].
Drawing on Suchman’s [33] account, we find it useful to
think of design processes less as ways that designers can
formulate needs and measure outcomes, and more as
shaping and staging encounters between multiple parties.
The essence of the process is the fact of different people
coming together and meeting – holding a conversation
rather than following a recipe. What this draws our
attention to, then, is, first, the context of that encounter – its
histories, its politics, those who are present and those who
are not, the authorities and responsibilities with which
different people speak – and, second, the bidirectionality of
the exchange. It directs us to think about what people bring
into the encounter and what they take away from it.
For instance, consider Hayden’s [18] discussion of
bioprospecting processes in Mexico, in which scientists
from US and European pharmaceutical companies sought to
identify the active ingredients in traditional remedies that
could then be incorporated into new drugs. This encounter
is framed by very different understandings of the kind of
attentive to the fact that such translations are intentional and
explicit acts whereby statements produced for one purpose
are made amenable to new purposes and new actors. The
translations, then, by which statements about domains and
needs become statements about technology and solutions,
must also be seen as purposeful, partial, and situated.
While HCI research has recognized the cultural specificity
of design products, the processes and methods of design has
largely been imagined as universal. Taking a broader view,
we would argue that methods – the products of research
communities, economic actors, and educational practices
that span the globe – are always transnationally produced
and dynamic. When an open source software (OSS) team or
a proprietary design team meets in Silicon Valley, they are
simultaneously negotiating their products and their methods
in situ. The two are not easily separable. In the same way,
Indian OSS teams or proprietary software designers are also
engaging in the same talk and practice around their
products and methods. As design methods move around in
the world, they are subject to different interpretations and
they become locally meaningful design in different ways.
Engagement, articulation, and translation are only three
aspects of varied, highly situated practices of design. Yet
examining these aspects through the lenses provided by
STS and postcolonial studies exposes some tacit
commitments and thus limitations of current approaches.
CONCLUSIONS
We have raised a number of issues relevant to information
technology drawn from STS and postcolonial studies. We
have argued that these considerations are particularly
significant in the context of current migrations HCI into
new settings, but they have been largely absent from the
research literatures in this area. Yet we do not mean to
suggest that design over “there” is fundamentally different
than design “here.” While the cultural traditions of UCD
have often emerged out of Western traditions, those
traditions themselves are contradictory and multiple. There
is no single “here” of Western knowledge and design.
Incommensurability might mark relations not only between
different national cultures, but also organizational cultures,
or even professional communities within an organization.
Our goal is not to criticize ongoing work in HCI4D and
cross-cultural design, but rather to expand the conversation
around cross-cultural technology development by placing it
in a broader context. Understanding the processes of
translation of design methods (both in the sense of
movement and in the sense of transformation) is a means to
this end. Similarly, it is important to avoid simple dualisms
between developed and developing contexts, traditional and
scientific knowledge practices, and so on. In his study of
development efforts, Gupta shows that simple dualities of
traditional and modern, developed and undeveloped,
colonial and (historically) postcolonial do not hold [16].
Rather, we call for an investigation of how, out of the
encounter between different forms of knowledge and
practice, new hybrid forms design and technology are
generated. Communication is bidirectional here, and as the
postcolonial perspective vividly demonstrates, the
encounters here are not instantaneous and fleeting, but
rather take place over years and decades.
We argue for attentiveness to the emergence of hybrid
practices in information technology design, coupled with
sensitivity to how uneven power relations are enacted in
design practice. The goal, as we have outlined here, is not
simply to bemoan the problems that arise when methods are
assumed to move easily and stably from one setting to
another, but rather to understand the diverse forms design
practice and contextual reasons for that diversity. We have
suggested that thinking about the design process in terms of
engagements between different groups, the complexities of
articulating perspectives, and the implications of translation
between sites, provides a starting point for acknowledging
and embracing heterogeneity in design, rather than
attempting to control or eliminate it.
While we have been looking at design primarily in the
context of HCI4D, concerns of power, mutual intelligibility,
and how cultural forms are generated are also relevant to
the intercultural encounters between designers and users in
traditional corporate or academic contexts. Suchman [33]
framed the work that she and her colleagues conducted at
Xerox as the staging of encounters amongst various
stakeholders, including engineers and workers. The lens of
HCI4D defamiliarizes design so that we may understand its
methods more deeply. Locating these commitments allows
us to imagine what practices with alternate commitments
might look like, and open new spaces for design [33].

ABSTRACT
Feminism is a natural ally to interaction design, due to its
central commitments to issues such as agency, fulfillment,
identity, equity, empowerment, and social justice. In this
paper, I summarize the state of the art of feminism in HCI
and propose ways to build on existing successes to more
robustly integrate feminism into interaction design research
and practice. I explore the productive role of feminism in
analogous fields, such as industrial design, architecture, and
game design. I introduce examples of feminist interaction
design already in the field. Finally, I propose a set of femi-
nist interaction design qualities intended to support design
and evaluation processes directly as they unfold.

INTRODUCTION
As a movement and an academic discipline, feminism has
been prominent for over half a century. Infused throughout
many aspects of everyday life, it is hardly a surprise that
feminist concerns also touch on the topic of interaction.
And indeed, as I argue later in this paper, it has already
affected HCI in positive ways. Yet as a field, even when we
are pursuing goals that can be called “feminist,” we tend
not to engage explicitly with feminism. As computers in-
creasingly become a part of everyday life for ever-
increasing populations in the world—from the rise of do-
mestic computing in the West to the rise of ICTs for devel-
oping countries—the stakes have never been higher. Digital
interactions mediate people’s relationships with friends and
loved ones, with society, and with culture itself. As we as-
pire to develop more pervasive, ubiquitous, and universal
technologies, we inevitably also must engage in the increas-
ing moral and intellectual complexity of our professional
activities.
This topic is hardly new to computing: science and technol-
ogy studies (STS) and social informatics have long empha-
sized these sorts of issues. Yet when it comes to interaction
design—HCI proper—these concerns come up in a much
more piecemeal and ad hoc way. For the purpose of this
paper, I therefore confine my focus to the relationships be-
tween feminism and interaction design (as opposed to
“computing” or “technology” more generally).
Specifically, I am concerned with the design and evaluation
of interactive systems that are imbued with sensitivity to the
central commitments of feminism—agency, fulfillment,
identity and the self, equity, empowerment, diversity, and
social justice. I also seek to improve understanding of how
gender identities and relations shape both the use of interac-
tive technologies and their design. Additionally, feminist
HCI entails critical perspectives that could help reveal un-
spoken values within HCI’s dominant research and design
paradigms and underpin the development of new ap-
proaches, methods and design variations.
Likely outcomes of this agenda include contributions such
as the following:
• A comprehensive introduction to issues of gender and
feminism as they pertain specifically to the professional
practice and theorization of interaction design
• A generative integration of specific feminist perspectives
in HCI and interaction design, that is, ways that femi-
nism can support creative activity and novel problem-
solving approaches
• Examinations of how technologies construct and per-
petuate gender and the ensuing implications for the prac-
tice of design
• Attempts to move beyond the piecemeal use of feminist
ideas in HCI, so as to integrate feminism in a more intel-
lectually rigorous way
• Contributions toward the development and legitimization
of a Feminist HCI research agenda that encompasses
both theory and design practice
While feminism is generally known as a critical strategy,
which too often suggests that feminism is only applicable

after the fact, in these bullets and the rest of the paper, I
stress the potential for feminism to contribute to an action-
based design agenda. That is, feminist approaches can inte-
grate seamless and productively in all stages of the design
process, including user research, prototyping, and evalua-
tion.
To clarify the goals, intentions, and resources for such an
agenda, I provide in the ensuing sections a brief overview
of feminism as an intellectual discipline; an introduction to
feminism in cognate fields, including STS, industrial de-
sign, and game design; a summary of the state of the art of
feminism in HCI today; and I then propose a set of feminist
interaction design qualities to clarify and solidify the femi-
nist HCI agenda.
REINTRODUCING FEMINISM
Portrayals of feminism, in politics, the media, and even in
HCI conferences, suggest that this household word is not
always well understood. In this section, I offer a brief sum-
mary of the ways feminism, as an academic field, construes
itself. Academically, feminism is often seen as a domain of
critical theory that examines “the ways in which literature
(and other cultural productions) reinforces or undermines
the economic, political, social, and psychological oppres-
sion of women.” [72]. Feminism integrates a collection of
theories, analytical and interpretative methodologies, ethi-
cal values, and political positions, which have evolved over
the past two centuries.
A Summary History of Feminism
Summarizing historically, feminism has gone through three
major phases [76]:
• First-wave feminism (1830s-1920s) refers to the suffra-
gette movement in the late 19th century/early 20th cen-
tury in the US and UK that focuses on women’s rights to
vote and participate in democratic government.
• The second wave of feminism (1960s-1980s) corre-
sponds with the intellectual movement of liberal human-
ism and is concerned with the emancipation of women
from patriarchal structures and argues against the oppres-
sion of women. It includes liberal feminism, radical
feminism, and black feminism among others.
• The third and present wave of feminism achieved critical
mass in the early 1990s and confronts the second wave’s
essentialist position on femininity. It includes postmod-
ern feminism, post-colonial feminism, and eco-feminism,
among others. For the third wave, rather than treating
“female” and “femininity” as given facts, biological or
otherwise, third-wave feminism explores the construc-
tion of gender in media, institutions, embodied perform-
ances, scientific discourse, and so on. The third wave
builds on the famous dictum of Simone de Beauvoir,
“One is not born a woman, but becomes one” [31].
By making visible the manifold ways that gender is con-
structed in everyday life, contemporary feminism seeks to
generate opportunities for intervention, making it a natural
ally to design.
Feminist Epistemologies
The transition to third-wave HCI [16,45] represents not
only a turn to a different sort of computing, but also to new
epistemologies better suited to our changing design practice
needs. Thus we have the continued exploration of Heideg-
gerian phenomenology [34] and computer scientists appro-
priating literary theory and pragmatist philosophy to offer
new ways of accounting for experience [59]. One of femi-
nism’s primary intellectual achievements has been the con-
struction of a critical strategy for developing epistemolo-
gies: feminist standpoint theory.
Feminist standpoint theory [46,43] begins with the supposi-
tion that all knowledge attempts are socially situated and
that some are better than others as starting points for
knowledge. Knowledge production is inevitably enmeshed
in acts of power, and in patriarchal societies, women’s
knowledge is suppressed. Accordingly, feminist standpoint
theory advocates for the use of women’s viewpoints and
experiences as an alternative point of departure for social
science research. This theory holds that cultural expecta-
tions and conventions in patriarchal societies limit women
to certain roles with differential access to resources. The
result is that women hold and produce different types of
knowledge from their male counterparts, and that these dif-
ferent types of knowledge should be recognized and utilized
as a resource, rather than marginalized. Feminist standpoint
theory thus attempts to reconfigure the epistemic terrain and
valorize the marginal perspectives of knowledge, so as to
expose the unexamined assumptions of dominant epistemo-
logical paradigms, avoid distorted or one-sided accounts of
social life, and generate new and critical questions [2].
Feminist standpoint theory’s privileging of alternative epis-
temologies simultaneously introduces a new domain of user
research—the “marginal” user, which forces us to think
through what that would mean—and implies a new set of
strategies and methods for user research.
FEMINISM IN COGNATE FIELDS
Interaction design is increasingly positioning itself as a de-
sign discipline, comparable to product design, information
design, graphic design, fashion, and architecture. At the
same time, HCI has always been the human face of engi-
neering, and accordingly it has deep ties with psychology,
science and technology studies and social informatics.
Though its place in HCI remains somewhat unclear and
underdeveloped, feminism is relatively established in all of
these related fields. Thus, as a point of departure, we can
consider how practitioners and researchers in these fields
apply feminism in their work and specifically how their
professional practice embodies feminist thinking.CHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1302
Feminism in STS
Science and technology studies (STS) investigate how so-
cial, political, and cultural values and assumptions affect
technological advancement and scientific research; it also
investigates the converse, that is, the influences science and
technology have on society. STS theorists postulate that
ideas about women and men shape science and technology,
evident in the decades-long practice of more men than
women studying computer science, designing, implement-
ing, administering network infrastructure, purchasing and
using Internet and digital devices. The combination of the
underrepresentation of women in these domains and the
universalizing aspirations about the design and use of in-
formation and communication technologies have led STS
researchers to warn of a digital divide and call attention to
the inequities caused by technology’s troubling relationship
with gender [70, 42, 75, 49, 55, 47, 74].
Some application areas in HCI with obvious potential to
benefit from this kind of thinking include accessible inter-
action, with its aspirations for “universal” design.
Feminism in Product and Industrial Design
Feminism is also established in the fields of design research
and industrial design. Commenting on the role of feminist
approaches in questioning how traditional design histories
are understood and recorded, Victor Margolin writes,
“Feminism is the most powerful critique of design history
thus far” [cited in 6]. Design critic Philippa Goodall ob-
serves, “We live in a world designed by men. It is not for
nothing that the expression ‘man-made’ refers to a vast
range of objects that have been fashioned from physical
material” [37]. Feminist design critics note that women as
consumers and designers of artifacts are conditioned by the
dominant (i.e., male) groups. Feminist design historian
Cheryl Buckley writes that the notion of patriarchy is cen-
tral to understanding women’s role in design (i.e., how they
are omitted from design and are often only referenced in
relation to their male partners and/or family members). The
result, she states, is that patriarchy in design prevents
women from participating fully in all areas of society as
well as different sectors of design. Buckley advocates the
use of feminist theory in design research to “delineate the
operation of patriarchy and the construction of the ‘femi-
nine’” and urges design researchers to understand women’s
contributions to design as a product of a sexual division of
labor [20].
Cockburn and Ormrod use feminist design criticism to ex-
amine the design and dissemination of the microwave and
the associated projection of women as consumers and ob-
jects in gendered advertising. They highlight how the de-
sign of the domestic technological artifact (i.e., microwave)
is shaped by gender identity, and they consider a feminist
strategy of change to productively overcome the divergence
in gendered subjectivities in the design and use of everyday
objects and technologies [27]. Gender identity and subjec-
tivity are also increasingly important in the study of con-
sumers’ decision processes with regard to the acquisition,
collection, and disposal of communication technologies
[30,7,54].
Possible application areas in HCI for this strand of femi-
nism include domestic computing and ICTs for developing
countries.
Feminism in Architecture and Urban Planning
Architecture is a discipline that is centrally concerned with
the production and consumption contexts of the design arti-
fact, since buildings largely determine artifacts’ physical
boundaries. Feminist perspectives have played a significant
role in the field of architecture since late 1970s, in the con-
ceptualization of space and the built environment [28,63].
To Weisman [78], built environments are conditioned by
social, political, and economic forces, and feminist criticism
can contribute to our understanding of the impact of these
forces upon urban spaces and domestic landscapes.
Building upon Weisman, Rothschild et al [65] explore spa-
tial arrangements in dwellings and neighborhoods and ex-
amine how they manifest assumptions about people’s
needs, family relationships, as well as home and work. Fo-
cusing on environments, such as urban landscapes, the
kitchen table, and housing design, etc., they conclude that
these assumptions are often the result of the dominant ide-
ologies. Anthony [3] promotes architectural designs that are
more “sensitive to the needs of a diverse population.”
Feminism in architecture is integrated with the field in di-
verse ways: influencing architectural practice in general,
creating a space for women architects to work, as well as
contributing to the theorization of architecture as a disci-
pline, from artifacts (buildings) to the contexts and spaces
they help create.
Application areas in HCI for these applications of feminism
include ubiquitous and pervasive computing, mobile com-
puting, and domestic computing, among others.
Feminism in Game Design
Leisure technologies, with their immense popularity and
marketability, are a source of interaction design that em-
phasizes pleasurable and affective experiences, learning,
simulation, and creativity. In game design and research,
feminist concerns have long been at the forefront of the
field [22, 38, 1, 39, 44]. The portrayal of the female body,
for example, is a commonly discussed topic in video game
and virtual world research. Of course, women and games
have had a notoriously troubled history, from the domina-
tion of the game market by young men to such things as the
introduction of “breast physics” in the popular fighting
game Dead or Alive or the softcore imagery of the popular
magazine, Girls of Gaming [36]. Such features embody a
“male gaze,” which makes all players spectators of the fe-
male body. Physically formidable and sexually appealing to
young male players, these heroines invite players to identify
with them. This hybrid idealization of traditionally maleCHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1303
and female characteristics suggests that the construction
and presentation of gender is very much part of the design
of gaming experience. A more positive example is Laurel
[53], whose game Purple Moon seeks to offer gameplay
appropriate for pre-adolescent girls, replacing sexualized
heroines killing monsters with play that enables girls to
explore their concerns about friendship and other social
development issues—a strategy that presumably could be
used to design games for boys as well. Another positive
example is Isbister [50], who explores the linkage between
a robust array of gender-based preferences and player satis-
faction through improved identification and/or roleplay-
ing/fantasy.
Application areas in HCI that might benefit from this work
include affective computing, intimate interaction, and ex-
perience design.
FEMINISM IN HCI: THE STATE OF THE ART
HCI continues to expand beyond the preoccupations with
how efficiently a system performs and is becoming increas-
ingly concerned with culture [8, 9, 5], society [11], and
interested in the experiential qualities of computing [59].
The discipline stands to benefit from feminism, whose theo-
ries and concepts have much to offer HCI due to its com-
mitments to issues such as the home, the constitution of
gender and the self in everyday life, the indirect effects of
design, alternative epistemologies, craft, emotion, desire,
embodiment, performance, surveillance/gaze, and reflec-
tiveness, among many others.
Of course, feminism is already a part of HCI, both because
feminism is a part of the fields that are inputs to HCI as
well as because of work in HCI that takes on concerns tra-
ditionally associated with feminism. Bødker and Green-
baum [14] apply gender perspectives to explore informal
work relationship of systems developers. In an edited an-
thology on information technology and office systems,
Green and her colleagues explore the intersection between
gendered patterns of work relations and the design of ICTs
[40]. Cassell [23] questions how gender differences, in par-
ticular, a deficit model of women and technology, under-
mine the design and development of interactive systems.
Taylor and Swan pay special attention to women’s work in
the design and use of home organizing systems, such as
calendars and to-do lists [68]. De Angeli & Bianchi-
Berthouze focus on the examination of attitudinal and be-
havioral differences between men and women in the per-
ception, acceptance, and usage of interactive technologies
at AVI 2006 [32]. Bell and Dourish critique the inadequate
use of family as the unit of analysis for domestic technol-
ogy design, because male and female members of the fam-
ily use technology in diverse ways [9]. In the ECSCW 2009
conference, Rode & Bødker attempt to forge connections
between gender theory and computer supported cooperative
work [64]. Clearly HCI is already benefitting from and con-
tributing to feminist perspectives. The question moving
forward is how to solidify these gains and more systemati-
cally integrate them into the field, e.g., in interaction design
pedagogy, textbooks, and everyday practice.
OPPORTUNITIES TO DRAW ON FEMINISM IN HCI
RESEARCH
For all of the changes that have come to HCI in the past
decade, i.e., the changes brought on during the so-called
“cultural turn” in HCI, usability remains in many ways at
the center of the discipline. Yet if usability is to evolve to
meet the challenges of third-wave HCI, it needs some up-
dating. Universality, a value traditionally associated with
masculinity, continues to dominate usability evaluation
(e.g., mental models, Fitts’ and Hicks’ laws, usability lab
protocols) and design methods (e.g., design process models
such as waterfall and agile, design principles). De Angeli &
Bianchi-Berthouze are correct in pointing out that “while
gender is routinely controlled in usability evaluations, little
is actually known on whether and how differences in gen-
der should influence the design of interactive software.”
[32]. The interaction design process takes place independ-
ent of gender considerations, and even today the central
concept of the whole field—the user—remains genderless.
Gender preferences regarding UI components is of great
interest to interaction designers and researchers alike,
though it can be a contentious issue that becomes entangled
in cultural expectations and even stereotypes [57, 69].
The growing body of domestic technology research in HCI
manifests the field’s increasing concern with new kinds of
accounts of human interactions. These new accounts are
increasingly informed by phenomenological, rather than
rationalist, approaches. Domestic lives are subjective and
emotional, and the “home” is more than the mere physical
space of a house or apartment; it is also a cultural construct
where gender identity plays a major role. Home lives,
whether or not information technologies are involved, are
often dictated by gender norms [29, 26, 10]. Thus, beyond
the phenomenological accounts, which excel at subjective
and experiential categories of use, one could argue that
feminist approaches can bring clarity to the way that sub-
jectivity and experience with technology are gendered—and
what designers could and should do about that.
Feminism could also help us engaging with difficult di-
lemmas such as the following: How do we simultaneously
serve real-world computing needs and avoid perpetuating
the marginalization of women and indeed any group in
technology? It would seem that serving existing needs—the
traditional approach to HCI—is conservative and perpetu-
ates the status quo. Conversely, an activist stance is prob-
lematic because it seems to privilege the social values of the
designer. This is a vital ethical dilemma that is central to
domestic computing and ICTs for developing countries, and
our field as yet offers little practical guidance on how to
cope with it.
Another potential intersection of feminism and HCI is
ubiquitous computing. Ubicomp continues to stand on anCHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1304
updated version of Weiser’s 1991 vision in which technolo-
gies disappear and “weave themselves into the fabric of
everyday life” [77]. An operationalized vision of this sort
not only entails speculations about future technologies and
interactions, but it also forces us to imagine and even com-
mit to conceptualizations of space and place in light of
these new technologies.
Humanist geography, and its offshoot feminist geography,
is productive in helping us understand the locus of social
interaction and power dynamics presented in space and
place as a result of pervasive technologies. For example,
feminist geographers often consider the body as a place, a
“location or site...of the individual” [60]. Judith Butler de-
velops the influential concept of “performativity,” regard-
ing gender as a performance in the “stylized repetition of
acts” [21]. These perspectives prompt questions such as the
following: How does a culturally constituted body enact
community rules, beliefs, rituals, and power dynamics
through Ubicomp’s new spaces? How are places
(re)configured as a result of Ubicomp to enable such per-
formances?
Feminist theory is also productive in helping us understand
the phenomena of social media and the culture of user-
generated content. Gender identity play, sexism, and even
sexual harassment are well known phenomena of social
lives online and deserve further research [83, 67]. What is
the role of gender in social media and virtual worlds? How
do we design for different artificial gender (i.e., virtual
cross-dressing), and how does and should it shape and af-
fect interactions online?
In sum, I see the contribution of feminist theories and
methods to HCI in the following ways:
• Theory: Feminism can critique core operational concepts,
assumptions, and epistemologies of HCI, and at the same
time, open up opportunities for the future
• Methodology: Interaction designers and researchers can
incorporate feminism in user research, iterative design,
and evaluation methodologies to broaden their repertoire
for different contexts and situations
• User Research: The notion of “the user” can be updated
to reflect gender in a way that noticeably and directly af-
fects design
• Evaluation: Feminism can help make visible ways that
designs configure users as gendered/social subjects—and
what implications these configurations bear for future
design work
QUALITIES OF FEMINIST INTERACTION
In their Thoughtful Interaction Design, Löwgren and Stol-
terman introduce a set of “use-oriented qualities of digital
artifacts” as a way to articulate a holistic, pervasive collec-
tion of traits that characterizes a given design artifact [56].
My approach in this section is to extend this notion of
“qualities” to develop a range of feminist interaction design
qualities. These qualities are not, in themselves, necessarily
unique to feminism; indeed, many of them already figure in
various ways in HCI literature, most noticeably in third-
wave HCI, in areas such as experience design, critical tech-
nical practice, and designing for interpretation and appro-
priation. Rather, it is this constellation of qualities—all of
them appearing together in a critical mass—that I argue
characterizes feminist interaction. The qualities I propose as
a starting point are as follows: pluralism, participation, ad-
vocacy, ecology, embodiment, and self-disclosure.
Pluralism
Feminist standpoint theory critiques Western scientific epis-
temology, arguing that while science presents itself as natu-
ral and universal, and in doing so it becomes normative. A
key feminist strategy is to denaturalize normative conven-
tions, both exposing their constructedness as human dis-
courses situated in socio-political institutions and exploring
alternative approaches. A related strategy is to investigate
and even nurture the marginal, for here alternatives to nor-
malizing discourses are often most visible. The quality of
pluralism refers to design artifacts that resist any single,
totalizing, or universal point of view. This may seem like an
obvious point, but even today, the introduction to a major
HCI textbook published in 2009 [66] has a long section
devoted to “Universal Usability.” Likewise, “universal ac-
cessibility” remains at least a rhetorical goal of accessible
computing.
The rise of information and communication technologies
for developing countries research in HCI is a fertile ground
for products that exhibit the pluralist quality of interaction
design. Several projects in recent years have critiqued the
Western universalism in technological advancement in de-
veloping countries, most notably in [35, 19]. A timeless and
universal stance in cross-cultural design is dangerous be-
cause it demotes cultural, social, regional, and national dif-
ferences in user experiences and outlooks. It also quietly
and usually unintentionally imposes—without transparent
or rational justification—Western technological norms and
practices. In other words, universalizing approaches not
only violate the standards of feminism, but they also violate
the standards of science itself, because they cannot offer
scientifically acceptable accounts of themselves.
We can see an example of this in the failed implementation
of Whirlpool’s “World Washer,” in which a design was
based on a universalizing model of clothes washing (includ-
ing the shape, weight, and durability of clothes themselves),
rather than direct contact and engagement with target user
groups. When this washing machine was sent to south In-
dia, use of the washing machine led to the destruction of
personal property (especially Indian women’s saris, a frag-
ile garment that is typically invested in profound emotional
significance), frustrating user experiences, and impediment
to adoption [25].CHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1305
A more positive example is the design and release of “Ran-
goli,” a visual phonebook for low-literate users in rural In-
dia [51]. Recognizing that in developing countries language
and literacy are barriers that prevent people from using
simple and essential applications like a phonebook on mo-
bile phones, the design team engaged in extensive user
studies in the villages of Chinchavli and Ukarul. The design
team observed and interviewed people to learn how they
currently stored phone numbers and contact information on
paper, using small notepads (referred by locals as “dia-
ries”), as well as how this paper-based system was imbued
with personal and cultural characteristics. The design team
recorded the conventions of organization principles of con-
tact entries (both in the case of textual entries and number
entries) found in these users’ diaries with regard to lan-
guages (e.g., types of languages, whether alphabet order is
used, etc.) and alternative organization schemes (e.g., by
locations of the contact). The situated user research led to
the design of “Rangoli,” a phonebook that enables low-
literate users to organize contacts’ phone numbers into col-
ors and icons in nine color pages. On each page a total of
nine icons are displayed in that color. A contact is associ-
ated with a color and an icon, and all contacts can be ac-
cessed by pressing only two buttons on the number pad.
The quality of pluralism rejects the claims to universalism
not on dogmatic terms, but because of the practical benefits
of such an understanding. Pluralist designs are likely to be
more human-centered than universalizing designs simply
because “human” is too rich, too diverse, and too complex a
category to bear a universal solution. Pluralist design en-
courages an alternative sensibility to design, foregrounding
questions of cultural difference, encouraging a constructive
engagement with diversity, and embracing the margins both
to be more inclusive and to benefit from the marginal as
resources for design solutions.
Participation
In conducting user research, sketching, prototyping, and
evaluation, designers inevitably establish relationships with
users as subjects. In controlled laboratory experiments, such
as traditional usability studies, researchers establish an ob-
jective, distant, and scientific relationship with subjects. In
auto-ethnographic research, anthropologists and user re-
searchers obviously have quite an intimate relationship with
subjects. The quality of participation refers to valuing par-
ticipatory processes that lead to the creation and evaluation
of design prototypes.
This quality depends on an epistemological position,
namely that knowers are not substitutable for one another.
The scientific value of replicability is based on the notion
that different scientists collecting data from similar sources
or populations and analyzing that data in the same ways
should come up with similar findings. Yet much of design
cannot be known scientifically, and ongoing participation
and dialogue among designers and users can lead to valu-
able insights that could not be achieved scientifically. A
participatory approach is compatible with empathic user
research [81] that avoids the scientific distance that cuts the
bonds of humanity between researcher and subject, pre-
empting a major resource for design (empathy, love, care).
This, of course, is not an argument against usability testing
or other scientific strategies. Rather, we need to comple-
ment such approaches with participatory processes, espe-
cially when considering interaction-related phenomena that
are deeply personal and subjective.
The participatory design (PD) movement originated in
Scandinavia in the late 1960s and early 1970s illustrate de-
sign artifacts with such multi-voiced, participative quality.
Projects such as Utopia and AT [13, 15] recognize and lev-
erage the values of workers’ participation in the improve-
ment of the quality of information system design. Relying
on the principle of collective resources, different groups of
stakeholders (e.g., workers and managers) were brought in
during the design process as a way to explore understand-
ings of work practices and to inform design.
Contemporary examples of PD include the involvement of
museum goers to contribute to exhibition design [71]; ef-
forts to motivate community members to contribute to the
resolution of local, community problems [58]; and the en-
gagement of patients, medical professionals, and software
developers in the improvement of dental practices [24].
Each of these approaches is inclusive and collaborative.
They all demonstrate a respect for the expertise of different
perspectives, including non-professional ones, regardless of
backgrounds, status, and technical know-how.
Advocacy
As noted earlier, design often entails an ethical dilemma. In
conducting needs analyses based on empirical research,
designers are focusing on and working within the status
quo. If they are not careful, they may perpetuate regressive
and harmful practices and structures in service of usability.
Conversely, designers that take an advocacy position, seek-
ing to offer progressive design solutions, run the risk of
imposing their own values on users and other stakeholders.
The quality of advocacy engages with this dilemma seri-
ously. On the one hand, feminist interaction design should
seek to bring about political emancipation and not just keep
up with it. At the same time, it should also force designers
to question their own position to assert what an “improved
society” is and how to achieve it. Participatory approaches
just described are a natural ally to this quality, because they
distribute the authority and responsibility for such decisions
across a polyvocal dialogue among stakeholders.
We can see this quality in tools designed for improving the
lives of underrepresented populations in developing coun-
tries, such as Nokia Life Tools [61] or Ishakti [62]. These
devices provide tailored information synchronized with
crop cycles and weather, for example, so that farmers can
maximize their productivity and make informed decisions
about markets and pricings. These tools not only enableCHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1306
individual users to design a personalized user experience,
but they also empower people in isolated communities to
participate in discourses, markets, and institutions previ-
ously out of reach.
Ecology
Material ecology theory emphasizes the extent to which an
artifact participates in a system of artifacts [73, 52]. This
structural approach considers ways that relationships among
artifacts determine their meaning in the system or ecology.
Extending this notion of material ecology, the quality of
ecology in feminist interaction design integrates an aware-
ness of design artifacts’ effects in their broadest contexts
and awareness of the widest range of stakeholders through-
out design reasoning, decision-making, and evaluation. It
invites interaction designers to attend to the ways that de-
sign artifacts in-the-world reflexively design us [79], as
well as how design artifacts affect all stakeholders.
The “Hoosier” cabinet [48], a kitchen cabinet popular in the
early twentieth century and the predecessor of the modern
kitchen cabinet, is an interesting example of a design that
participated in the changing ecology of the American
kitchen in the early twentieth century. With the rise of in-
dustrialism, household servants were leaving domestic ser-
vice and entering factories, leaving well-to-do families to
take on domestic chores on their own. Marketed as “the
greatest household help that womankind has ever received
at the hands of science,” a design that “makes kitchen work
a joy” [48], the Hoosier cabinet was equipped with a pull-
out counter as a large work surface, a flour bin/sifter, and
dedicated, built-in storage for various cooking utensils,
supplies, pots, and pans.
The design rationale behind the Hoosier cabinet was to in-
crease homemakers’ efficiency in part to compensate for
the loss of the household servant. The cabinet was a success
in introducing new efficiencies into the kitchen. Less wel-
come from my perspective was its ecological byproduct:
rather than emancipating women from household work, it
more completely identified them with it: the tagline in con-
temporary ads boasted, over a picture of a woman in front
of the Hoosier cabinet, “The best servant in your house.” In
short, the homemaker, once the mistress in the former
kitchen ecology, has become a servant in the new one.
In HCI, we see a rising interest in the concept of ecology,
both from the standpoint of systems theory [52] and in the
environmental sense with the rise of sustainable interaction
design [11]. What remains is to continue extending these
rising ecological perspectives into considerations of gender,
race, social class, developing countries, and so forth.
Embodiment
HCI’s early tendency to understand the user in disembodied
ways (e.g., mental models, information processing theories
of the user) were criticized as early as the 1980s [80]. From
situated action theory to embodied interaction, the field has
since made significant progress in dealing with the embod-
ied nature of human-computer interaction. The next stage of
this agenda, that is, development on the quality of embodi-
ment, needs to push embodiment in the direction of gender
commonalties and differences, gender identity, human
sexuality, pleasure and desire, and emotion.
Much of this work is already underway: HCI’s recent pre-
occupation with emotion [17], fun [12], spirituality [82],
food [41], sexuality [18; 4], embodied interactions [34], and
whole-body interactions [33] is demonstrative of the sig-
nificance of focalizing the agency of interaction not on the
interface or its designer, but the bodies, motivating drives,
and primordial urges of users. More work needs to be done
on the differential ways that women and men experience
and perform interactions in these new contexts.
Self-disclosure
Every design is founded on assumptions about users. As a
field, user research helps us make these assumptions in rea-
soned ways. A byproduct of these assumptions is that every
design projects its own “ideal user.” The closer actual users
conform to this ideal, the easier, or more powerfully, or
more pleasurably they will interact with the design. For
example, a consumer tax application, such as TurboTax,
makes assumptions about the kinds of things its users know
and don’t know; the kinds of incomes and expenses they are
likely to have; the amount of time they can devote to doing
their taxes; and so on. A user who falls outside of this pro-
jected ideal user—because she understands the tax code
much better or worse than the software expects, or because
she has a more complex or more simple financial profile
than the program anticipates—could find that the software
simply fails her needs. This is a situation that is hard to
avoid, and it is naïve to suggest that tax software should
work for all people all of the time (i.e., be “universal”).
At the same time, we can also see that using software con-
stitutes users as subjects; that is, it makes us become the
kind of user the software is for, bracketing aside the rest of
ourselves that is not relevant to the software. The software
gives us an identity that we are pressured into accepting.
The quality of self-disclosure refers to the extent to which
the software renders visible the ways in which it effects us
as subjects. Self-disclosure calls users’ awareness to what
the software is trying to make of them, and it both intro-
duces a critical distance between users and interactions, and
also creates opportunities for users to define themselves for
software.
Amazon.com’s recommendation service is a good example
of self-disclosure. Many of us define ourselves both pub-
licly and privately based on the kinds of media we con-
sume, including movies, music, and books. Amazon tracks
several kinds of information about our media consumption
habits on its site, including purchasing habits, browsing
habits, wish listing habits, the habits of people with similar
profiles on Amazon, the habits of popular culture at-large,CHI 2010: HCI For AllApril 10–15, 2010, Atlanta, GA, USA1307
and so on. I am positioned not only as a media consumer,
but as a certain kind of media consumer.
At the same time, Amazon is transparent about how it con-
stitutes visitors as media consumers. Recommendations
often appear on the site accompanied by a link, “Fix this
recommendation.” Clicking the link exposes the algorithm
by which the user is constituted as a potential consumer of a
given item: it is because the user bought/browsed some
other item, which Amazon associates with the recom-
mended item. It then offers several mechanisms by which
the user can do something about it: one can rate items,
claim to own them, say it was a gift, and even check a box
called “Don’t use for recommendations.”
This process became valuable to me as an Amazon user
who is also a researcher of gender studies and human sexu-
ality. Due to a series of book purchases related to my field
of research, Amazon started recommending erotic fiction
and photobooks on my Amazon start page with pictures.
Not wanting to be visually constituted as a consumer of
erotica and even pornography—especially on a computer I
use in my office—I made use of these options to communi-
cate back to Amazon what kind of subject I want the appli-
cation to treat me as.
CONCLUSION
In offering this conceptualization of the Feminist HCI
agenda, I have referred to analogous fields, including STS,
architecture, and industrial design, and I have outlined a
vision of how feminism provides opportunities for the dis-
cipline. Building on these traditions and potentials, I have
articulated a series of qualities that compose my present
understanding of feminist interaction design. My goal in
doing this is not to propose a radical departure from what
we already do in HCI, but rather to clarify and solidify an
agenda that seems already to be underway but seldom rec-
ognized as such.
Stepping back, one can broadly distinguish among two gen-
eral ways that feminism contributes to interaction design:
Critique-based and generative.
• Critique-based contributions rely on the use of feminist
approaches to analyze designs and design processes in
order to expose their unintended consequences. Such
contributions indirectly benefit interaction design by
raising our sensibilities surrounding issues of concern.
• Generative contributions involve the use of feminist ap-
proaches explicitly in decision-making and design proc-
ess to generate new design insights and influence the de-
sign process tangibly. Such contributions leverage femi-
nism to understand design contexts (e.g., “the home” or
the “workplace”), to help identify needs and require-
ments, discover opportunities for design, offer leads to-
ward solutions to design problems, and suggest evalua-
tion criteria for working prototypes, etc.
Critique-based feminist approaches are already influential
in computing, especially in social informatics and STS. Yet
HCI is an action-oriented field driven by its practitioners,
who design interactions that (hopefully) improve lives.
Thus, there is an opportunity for the field to develop femi-
nism’s generative contribution type. As I have argued
throughout this paper, I believe that feminism has enormous
potential to affect design practice directly, helping us to
generate concrete new design directions and new ap-
proaches to studying users. Feminism has far more to offer
than pointing out instances of sexism after the fact. Cognate
fields offer models for what such contributions might look
like, and existing positive examples in HCI need recogni-
tion so that they might better serve as models for us to
move forward. The constellation of feminist interaction
design qualities I have offered here will hopefully serve as
the beginning of a conversation about how our community
moves this agenda forward.

BUILDING CONSENTFUL TECH 19
DIGITAL COMMUNITIES
More and more, our digital bodies exist in digital networks and communities.
Whenever there are multiple relationships between people, a type of
community or network is created. One type is formed when people sign up
for a service — as users, they are now in relationship with whoever owns
and works on the technology. Another type of community is created when
users interact with each other. Digital communities can overlap with physical
communities.
A COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY APPROACH
Accountability means being held responsible for your actions. The
accountability mechanisms available in most technologies are not good
enough. Blocking users who are harassing you does not easily stop them from
harassing others. Reporting an image that is harmful to you does not stop that
image from being posted by others and to other platforms.
Some people have called for police departments to become more
knowledgeable about current technology, and for lawmakers to create harsher
punishments for people who are committing violence online. But the problems
with this approach mirror those that are rampant in enforcement of sexual
assault laws. Often it is the person who experienced the harm who is blamed
Consentful technology
relies on community and
accountability
We have talked a lot about what we can do to build
more consentful technologies. But implementing
these measures can’t guarantee that non-consensual
actions will not happen. This is why community and
accountability are critical in addressing harm.
20 BUILDING CONSENTFUL TECH
— why did you send nude photos to your ex, or why didn’t you just ignore that
troll? And, for Black and Indigenous people, racialized immigrants, LGBTQ
people and more, police and prisons are key vectors of violence in daily life.
What if we built community-based responses to harm and violence into our
technologies?
When we act harmfully against others, whether it is intentional or not, there
is an impact on both that person and the community as a whole. This is true
whether the harm is interpersonal or caused by algorithms. So we must be
responsible to each other as individuals as well as members of a community.
This is what is meant by community accountability.
Community accountability is a community-based strategy, rather than a
police/prison-based strategy, to address violence within our communities.
Community accountability is a process in which a community — a group
of friends, a family, a church, a workplace, an apartment complex, a
neighborhood, etc — work together to do the following things:
• Create and affirm values & practices that resist abuse and oppression and
encourage safety, support, and accountability
• Develop sustainable strategies to address community members’ abusive
behavior, creating a process for them to account for their actions and
transform their behavior
• Commit to ongoing development of all members of the community, and
the community itself, to transform the political conditions that reinforce
oppression and violence
• Provide safety & support to community members who are violently
targeted that respects their self-determination1
What would a community accountability approach to digital communities
look like? How would it work for both people who are users of the technology
in question, as well as people who might be impacted by it? How could this
change the way that the creators of algorithms are held accountable for the
harms that their biases cause?

BUILDING CONSENTFUL TECH 21
DIGITAL BODIES ARE
CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
IN DIGITAL RELATIONSHIPS
AND COMMUNITIES
Our digital bodies interact with each other,
intermediated by the servers they inhabit. Currently
all the control is in the environment, and the data
that makes up our digital bodies is passive and
lacks agency. By binding that data into a cell with
its own logic, protected by encryption, we could
restore autonomy to our digital bodies, allowing
interactions to involve us instead of acting upon us.
22 BUILDING CONSENTFUL TECH
STRONG COMMUNITIES GIVE RISE TO MORE
CONSENTFUL TECHNOLOGIES
When attention is paid to relationships, stronger communities result. This
is the case in physical communities as well as digital. Users and makers can
strengthen their communities and improve consent therein by asking:
• How can we better protect each other? For example, is there a technical
way to have other community members see and respond to harassing
messages, so the person who is targeted does not have to deal with the
barrage alone?
• How can we hold each other accountable as a community? What are
some community-based strategies for addressing non-consensual actions
that work on the roots of the issue?
• How can we better support and uplift each other? How can we
normalize asking for consent on our platform?
Small changes can make a big difference when we add a little friction to
pathways used for abusive behaviour, and when we make it easier for people
to help each other. For example, new users might have a quieter voice until
they’ve been around awhile, or messages mentioning you could be downvoted
by your friends so you won’t see them.
BUILDING CONSENTFUL TECH 23
The cost of interacting with technology securely is quite high, and those least
able to pay that cost are also those most at risk of harm when things break.
Just as we should not blame survivors for sexual violence, we must not place
the burden of safety on users in terms of who is responsible and who suffers
the consequences.
We see an alternative to this in consent culture. Consent culture is a culture
in which asking for consent permeates all our interactions small and large —
whether it’s asking before going in for a hug, checking in about taking a photo,
or asking whether a sexual activity feels okay. With technology mediating so
many of our daily interactions, it plays an increasingly large part in establishing
the type of culture we live in. Building consentful technology is not just about
our applications and data; it is about creating a culture of consent for the entire
world to share in.
Consentful technology
moves us towards
consent culture
Currently, achieving some measure of privacy and
security in technology requires active participation
from users, which means when that trust is violated it
is the users who pay the price, and often the users who
are blamed.

must be...
driving the events we do see. This ten-
dency to only see events is consistent
with our evolutionary history, which
was geared toward responding to any-
thing that posed an immediate danger
to our well-being. As we’ll see later in
this volume, it’s redesigning things at
the systemic level that offers us far more
leverage to shape our future than sim-
ply reacting to events does.
What Do Systems
Do? A Close Look
at Systemic Behavior
We’ve explored what defines systems and
how systems generate the patterns and
events we see around us. But how do we
actually start looking at reality from this
intriguing viewpoint? We need to do two
things: deepen our understanding of
how systems behave, and gain familiarity
with some terms and tools of systems
thinking in order to communicate our
understanding of that behavior. This sec-
tion “walks” you through some basic sys-
tem behaviors and uses two powerful
systems thinking tools—causal loop dia-
grams and behavior over time graphs—
to illustrate the concepts.
Fun with Feedback
To hone our systems thinking perspec-
tive, let’s look again at feedback. As we
saw earlier, feedback is the transmission
and return of information. The key
word here is return—it is this very char-
acteristic that makes the feedback per-
spective different from the more
common perspective: the linear cause-
and-effect way of viewing the world.
The linear view sees the world as a
series of unidirectional cause-and-effect
relationships: A causes B causes C
causes D, etc.
The feedback loop perspective, on
the other hand, sees the world as an
interconnected set of circular relation-
ships, where something affects some-
thing else and is in turn affected by it: A
causes B causes C causes A, etc.
As trivial as this distinction between
these two views may seem, it has pro-
found implications for the way we see
the world and for how we manage our
daily lives. When we take the linear
view, we tend to see the world as a
series of events that flow one after the
other. For example, if sales go down
(event A), I take action by launching a
promotions campaign (event B). I then
see orders increase (event C), sales rise
(event D), and backlogs increase (event
E). Then I notice sales decreasing again
(event F), to which I respond with
another promotional campaign (event
G) . . . and so on. Through the “lens” of
this linear perspective, I see the world as
a series of events that trigger other
events. Even though events B and G are
repeating events, I see them as separate
and unrelated.
From a feedback loop perspective
(see “Thinking in Loops” on p. 6), I
would be continually asking myself
“How do the consequences of my actions
feed back to affect the system?” So, when
I see sales go down (event A), I launch a
promotions campaign (event B). I see
orders increase (event C) and sales rise
(change in event A). But I also notice
that backlogs increase (event D)
(another eventual effect of event B),
which affects orders and sales (change in

We can gain even richer insights into systems by adding two more levels of per-
spective to the events/patterns/structure model. The two additional levels are
mental models and vision.
Mental models are the beliefs and assumptions we hold about how the world
works. We can view these assumptions as “systemic structure generators,”
because they provide the “blueprints” for those structures. In our example about
defective parts, maybe the production-line folks believe that they are responsible
only for what they produce, not what the shift after them produces. This mental
model may have led the company to create a structure whereby there is no over-
lap of staff during shift changes.
Vision is our picture of what we want for our future. It is the guiding force that
determines the mental models we hold as important as we pursue our goals. For
example, perhaps the people on each assembly-line shift hold a vision of compe-
tition—of striving to produce higher-quality products than any other shift. This
vision would drive the mental model that says that each line is responsible only
for what it produces.
See the “‘Acting’ in Different Modes” appendix on p. 17 for how to incorporate
mental models and vision into the events/patterns/structure framework and take
high-leverage actions to address a problem.
MENTAL MODELS AND VISION:
MORE LEVELS OF PERSPECTIVE
Looking for a Sign:
Loops and Labels
Before we go on to take a closer look at
how balancing loops play a key role in
systems, let’s take a moment to explore
two helpful features of causal loop dia-
grams in general: arrow labels and loop
labels. Throughout the rest of this vol-
ume, you’ll notice that the arrows in loop
diagrams are labeled with an “s” or “o.”
These labels show how one variable influ-
ences another: An “s” indicates that as one
variable changes, the next variable
changes in the same direction. (Or, the
first variable adds to the second variable.)
An “o” indicates that as one variable
changes, the other changes in the opposite
direction. (Or, the first variable subtracts
from the second variable.)
For example, each arrow in our sav-
ings-account/interest-payment loop
would be labeled with an “s,” because as
savings go up (or down), so do interest
payments. And as interest payments go
up (or down), so do savings. Notice
that the savings account diagram has an
“R” in the middle, too. This means that
the loop represents a reinforcing
process.
Here’s another example, this time of
a balancing process. Let’s say that when-
ever you get stressed out, you do some
relaxation exercises, which brings your
stress level down. In a diagram of this
system, the arrow going from stress
level to gap is labeled with an “s.” (As
your stress increases, so does the gap
between your actual and acceptable
level.) The arrow going from gap to use
of relaxation exercises is also labeled
with an “s.” (The bigger the gap, the
more you try to relax.) But the arrow
going from use of relaxation exercises
back to stress level is labeled with an
“o.” (As your use of relaxation exercises
increases, your stress decreases.) This
diagram would have a “B” in the mid-
dle, to indicate that it represents a bal-
ancing process. 2
One easy way to tell if you have a
reinforcing or balancing loop is to
count the number of “o’s.” If there are
no “o’s” or an even number of “o’s,” the
loop is reinforcing. If there is an odd
number of “o’s,” the loop is balancing.
However, even though this method is
convenient, you should still double-
check your reasoning by “walking”
around the loop and telling the story of
what it is depicting.
With these handy labels in mind, let’s
take a closer look at balancing loops.
The Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly: A Closer Look at
Balancing Loops
So far, the concept of a balancing loop
might sound simple: These processes
generally work to keep things stable.
But beware: Balancing processes are
actually pretty complex in real life. In
many cases, we can think of them as a
complicated blend of the “good” (the
desired goal), the “bad” (the actual situ-
ation that we don’t want), and the
“ugly” (our perception of the situation,
which we hate to examine). This makes
managing these loops a little tricky,
because people often have many differ-
ent perceptions of a situation—and
these perceptions can strongly affect the
situation itself.

2 In classic system dynamics, a plus sign (+) is
used instead of an “s,” and a minus sign (-)
instead of an “o.” A plus sign indicates posi-
tive feedback; a minus sign, negative feed-
back.
Here’s an opportunity to flex your general management skills by seeing your
responsibilities in terms of balancing loops. Think of a business goal that is
especially important to you. It may relate to employee development, sales, or
quality. Try to identify these four critical variables: Actual Level, Desired Level
(or Goal), Gap, and the Corrective Action you need to close the gap. You might
find the template below helpful.
Actual Level Desired Level
Gap
Corrective Action
YOU TRY IT: BALANCING LOOPS
By creating new systemic structures
(either through redesigning existing
ones or making new ones), we can
change the events and patterns we get.
We alter the system, rather than just
adapting or reacting to it. This is the
level at which many change efforts
operate (reorganizations, process
redesign, reengineering, compensation
schemes, etc.). In our defective-parts
example, we might alter the system by
creating an overlap of outgoing and
incoming assembly-line crews.
Mental Models—Reflective.
Altering systemic structures often
requires a change in our mental images
of what those structures can or ought
to be. In the example we’ve been fol-
lowing, if we truly believe that each
assembly-line shift is responsible only
for the quality of their products, then
we’ll never be able to imagine a differ-
ent structure, such as overlapping crews
who are each responsible for more than
just their own lines. Taking actions at
the level of mental models is reflective,
because it requires that we develop the
ability to surface, suspend, and question
our own assumptions about how the
world works and what’s most impor-
tant. This skill also involves inviting
others to do the same reflection with
their mental models. (Note, though,
that reflective actions do not include
trying to change someone else’s mental
models—that would simply be another
reactive action. Changes in our own
and others’ mental models come from
genuine reflection and clarity of vision,
not force.)
Vision—Generative. Surfacing,
reflecting on, and changing our mental
models is often a difficult and painful
process, because those mental models
are firmly embedded through years of
experience. Why would we choose to
put ourselves through the discomfort of
changing them? Because we have a
compelling vision of a new and differ-
ent world that we are committed to cre-
ating. At the level of vision, our actions
can be generative, bringing something
into being that did not exist before. For
example, a vision of providing the high-
est-quality products at all times
through cooperation among assembly-
line crews may generate the impetus to
reexamine our old mental models that
say that each crew is responsible only
for their own work.
Here’s another important thing to
notice about the levels of perspective:
Our ability to influence the future
increases as we move from the level of
events to that of vision. As we move up
these levels, our focus shifts from the
present to the future. Consequently, the
actions we take at the higher levels have
more impact on future outcomes, not
present events.
Does this mean that high-leverage
actions can be found only at the higher
levels? No—because leverage is a rela-
tive concept, not an absolute. For
instance, if you find yourself in front of
a runaway bus, that is probably not the
best time to become very reflective
about how you got yourself into that
situation (because you won’t be reflect-
ing for very long!). In this case, the
high-leverage action is to react fast and
get out of the way; any other action
would be inappropriate. There is lever-
age at every level, and the challenge lies
in learning when and how to take the
appropriate action for each level.

Design Justice
Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need
Buying optionsJoin the newsletter
By Sasha Costanza-Chock
The MIT Press
March 2020
An exploration of how design might be led by marginalized communities, dismantle structural inequality, and advance collective liberation and ecological survival.
What is the relationship between design, power, and social justice? “Design justice” is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims explicitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world.
This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people —specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply-burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism) — and invites readers to “build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.” Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival.

305MAKING SPACES: LABS, INSTITUTIONS, AND AUTONOMOUS ZONES
Outro
I wrote some of this text at my desk in an applied sciences school that hosts my research
project. Not too long ago, this place was someone's idea, an idea involving someone's agenda,
with someone's belief in serving the state, motivated by someone's hope for a better future
for some next generation, limited by someone's epistemological limits and ways of life. I am
sitting in a place that was once made up, conceived by a commission on paper, but that now
services me with infrastructures, endows and obliges me with power, and offers free and
good coffee. Perhaps, as you are reading this, you are in a similar space or are on your way
to one or from there. Once this train of thought has begun – that everything was someone's
idea at some point – one could think that everything is made up in some way, that we are all
experiencing a kind of constructivist make-belief. We've grown skeptical of the sometimes
destructive habit of creativity that we developed in our brief time on this planet. The power to
create more things, more frequently, no longer feels right. Aren't there things and places that
grow into being without our heavy heart and clumsy hands? Perhaps destructive, but nonethe-
less necessary, is the practice of emancipatory politics that attempts to dissolve everything that
makes itself appear as a natural order while being artificial, such as institutions established
by previous collective demands for a better life. Today, thousands of homeless people evicted
by the tech bubble need to make the asphalt of San Francisco their home. Simultaneously,
coding camps invite urban transitory people to integrate themselves into gainful employment,
programs backed by the very same sector that is causing their eviction. The natural order of
things – between the haves and have nots, between those in-the-know and those who know-
to-get-through, between the makers and won't-make-its – is rendered awfully naturalistic, if
one dares to actually look and listen. What is it that is critical at this time to make up?

(2)A contravention of subsection (1) (or a contravention of section 111 or 112 that relates to a contravention of subsection (1)) is enforceable as an unlawful act under Part 1 of the Equality Act 2006 (and, by virtue of section 120(8), is enforceable only by the Commission under that Part).
(3)A does not contravene a relevant disability provision merely by asking about B's health; but A's conduct in reliance on information given in response may be a contravention of a relevant disability provision.

(5)In the application of section 136 to the proceedings, the particulars of the complaint are to be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) of that section as facts from which the tribunal could decide that A contravened the provision.

(7)In subsection (6)(b), where A reasonably believes that a duty to make reasonable adjustments would be imposed on A in relation to B in connection with the work, the reference to a function that is intrinsic to the work is to be read as a reference to a function that would be intrinsic to the work once A complied with the duty.
(8)Subsection (6)(e) applies only if A shows that, having regard to the nature or context of the work—
(a)the requirement is an occupational requirement, and
(b)the application of the requirement is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.

(6)The reference to a concession in respect of something done by an association is a reference to a benefit, right or privilege having the effect that the manner in which, or the terms on which, it does it are more favourable than the manner in which, or the terms on which, it usually does the thing.]
Health and safety
2(1)An association (A) does not discriminate against a pregnant woman in contravention of section 101(1)(b) because she is pregnant if—

(2)Sub-paragraph (1) applies to section 102(1)(b) as it applies to section 101(1)(b); and for that purpose a reference to admitting a person to membership is to be read as a reference to inviting the person as a guest or permitting the person to be invited as a guest.
(3)An association (A) does not discriminate against a pregnant woman in contravention of section 101(2)(a) or (3)(a) or 102(2)(a) because she is pregnant if—
(a)the way in which A affords her access to a benefit, facility or service is intended to remove or reduce a risk to her health or safety,
(b)A reasonably believes that affording her access to the benefit, facility or service otherwise than in that way would create a risk to her health or safety,
(c)A affords persons with other physical conditions access to the benefit, facility or service in a way that is intended to remove or reduce a risk to their health or safety, and
(d)A reasonably believes that affording them access to the benefit, facility or service otherwise than in that way would create a risk to their health or safety.
(4)An association (A) which does not afford a pregnant woman access to a benefit, facility or service does not discriminate against her in contravention of section 101(2)(a) or (3)(a) or 102(2)(a) because she is pregnant if—

(b)A does not afford persons with other physical conditions access to the benefit, facility or service, and
(c)the reason for not doing so is that A reasonably believes that affording them access to the benefit, facility or service would create a risk to their health or safety.
(5)An association (A) does not discriminate against a pregnant woman under section 101(2)(c) or (3)(c) because she is pregnant if—

Section 189
SCHEDULE 21Reasonable adjustments: supplementary
Preliminary
1This Schedule applies for the purposes of Schedules 2, 4, 8, 13 and 15.
Binding obligations, etc.
2(1)This paragraph applies if—
(a)a binding obligation requires A to obtain the consent of another person to an alteration of premises which A occupies,
(b)where A is a controller of let premises, a binding obligation requires A to obtain the consent of another person to a variation of a term of the tenancy, or
(c)where A is a responsible person in relation to common parts, a binding obligation requires A to obtain the consent of another person to an alteration of the common parts.
(2)For the purpose of discharging a duty to make reasonable adjustments—
(a)it is always reasonable for A to have to take steps to obtain the consent, but
(b)it is never reasonable for A to have to make the alteration before the consent is obtained.
(3)In this Schedule, a binding obligation is a legally binding obligation in relation to premises, however arising; but the reference to a binding obligation in sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (c) does not include a reference to an obligation imposed by a tenancy.
(4)The steps referred to in sub-paragraph (2)(a) do not include applying to a court or tribunal.
Landlord's consent
3(1)This paragraph applies if—
(a)A occupies premises under a tenancy,
(b)A is proposing to make an alteration to the premises so as to comply with a duty to make reasonable adjustments, and
(c)but for this paragraph, A would not be entitled to make the alteration.
(2)This paragraph also applies if—
(a)A is a responsible person in relation to common parts,
(b)A is proposing to make an alteration to the common parts so as to comply with a duty to make reasonable adjustments,
(c)A is the tenant of property which includes the common parts, and
(d)but for this paragraph, A would not be entitled to make the alteration.
(3)The tenancy has effect as if it provided—
(a)for A to be entitled to make the alteration with the written consent of the landlord,
(b)for A to have to make a written application for that consent,
(c)for the landlord not to withhold the consent unreasonably, and
(d)for the landlord to be able to give the consent subject to reasonable conditions.
(4)If a question arises as to whether A has made the alteration (and, accordingly, complied with a duty to make reasonable adjustments), any constraint attributable to the tenancy must be ignored unless A has applied to the landlord in writing for consent to the alteration.
(5)For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) or (2), A must be treated as not entitled to make the alteration if the tenancy—
(a)imposes conditions which are to apply if A makes an alteration, or
(b)entitles the landlord to attach conditions to a consent to the alteration.
Proceedings before county court or sheriff
4(1)This paragraph applies if, in a case within Part 3, 4, 6 or 7 of this Act—
(a)A has applied in writing to the landlord for consent to the alteration, and
(b)the landlord has refused to give consent or has given consent subject to a condition.
(2)A (or a disabled person with an interest in the alteration being made) may refer the matter to [F411the county court] or, in Scotland, the sheriff.
(3)The county court or sheriff must determine whether the refusal or condition is unreasonable.
(4)If the county court or sheriff finds that the refusal or condition is unreasonable, the county court or sheriff—
(a)may make such declaration as it thinks appropriate;
(b)may make an order authorising A to make the alteration specified in the order (and requiring A to comply with such conditions as are so specified).

when superpowers fail to manii'cst, cligitirl spircc provides. The emergence of'
the cybernetic interface has posed an incipicnt and significant challenge to
some essentialisms as cyborg subjects generate new bodies and design new
selves in the choosing and fusing of new parts in a potentially endless process
of consumption and self-invention; the prosthesis of digital space enables a
mobility that promises both autonomy and inclusivity. But however transgres-
sive (and some avatars might be within certain parameters), these are choices
that may simultaneously participate in the reconstruction of a recombinant lib-
eral subject-continuouslyaccumulating surplus (material and cultural) capital
in late modernity. Such modes of cross-identification and cybernetic drag arc
coded as safe or entertaining, divorced from social consequence or politiial con-
ditions. Even as "warranting" (the process of making the physical body legible)
becomes problematic in digital space, the corporeal codes or tokens of "identity
tourism" or cross-identification can still be fetishized, and the relations of power
that produce aird circulate such narratives about specific bodies are concealed,
made invisible in electronic environments. These codes do not require the phys-
ical body that authorizes them into digital space to match, tobe warranted,bul
they invoke bodies nonetheless, and in very specific ways.
This may easily become the occasion for (a desire for) escape, a wish for
ir post-body future in which one might enjoy the exoticism of otherness or
dodge complicity by inhabiting that space of difference. Indeed, the fantasy
of becoming "other" (or some approximation of her) is a feature of modern
commodity culture and contributes to the apprehension of mobility for thc
liberal subject. The contemporary spectacle of multiculturalism appropriates
racial and national otherness for use in a range of fantasies of identificatiorr,
Lisa Nakamura describes this as "identity tourism"; writing of the Lambcla
MOO environment, she observes that'Asian-ness is co-opted as a'passing'
fancy, an identity-prosthesis that signifies sex, the exotic, passivity when femalc,
and anachronistic dreams of combat in its male manifestation."a In these uscr-
built environments, Nakamura suggests that the transgender and transracial
"identity tourist" who occupies the space of the "other" is engaged in a fantasy
of social control. The popular avatars that Nakamura discusses-the samuriri,
ninja, or mail-order bride-are deeply implicated as codes in contemporary
anxieties about gendered labor and transnational capital. That many of the
persons who adopt the identity of an "Asian Doll" in electronic environments
are, as Nakamura surmises, white men, would then suggest that the perforrna ltcc
eueer Cyborgs antl Ncw Mrrtarrts n 2{17
of transracial and transgender performance does not necessarily disrupt social
(or geopolitical) relations between specific bodies; digitar space ailows for the
nonmimetic act to be ideologically contained by the abstraction ofvirtual reality.
Released from an empiricar referent, the digitized token is circurated as ..pray,'
and severed from the socioporitical and ideological processes that froduce it.
Nonetheless, these codes reference a body politic and frameworks of culturar

boundaryless. If digital space makes porsiblJ a cartesian abstraction or the
commoditization of the flesh, it also suggests that there is no necessary mimetic

space represents a situation in which the interiority of subjectivity is no longer
easily located on the subject's flesh, potentially disrupting ,t " 1pr.ru_ption ofan) expressive relationship between embodiment and social identity. The image
in digital space does not necessarily refer to an actually existing object/subject

the contours of her historically specific biotechnological transformation from
human girlto something more.
But even if no cyborg is evcr born innocent-like Karma, born of a neocolo-
nial encounter and possessed of a comparable power to occupy other bodies-
this does not mean we may not simultaneo usly take somepleasure in our cyborgs
and yet interrogate the conditions oftheir existence, as science or fiction' Against
a nostalgic discourse ofauthentic selves or organic interaction, ofnatural bodies
and traditional communities, what might instead be revealed in digital space
is the constructedness of all selves, interaction, bodies' and communities; what
must be attended to are the structures and relations that produce different kinds
of subjects in position with different kinds of technologies.a3 While the cyborg
bodies we create to navigate these new spaces will not resolve the material reali-
ties or social contradictions oftheir manufacture, theyprovide a rich aSsemblage
of myths, legends, fears, fantasies, codes, and tools with which to interrogate
which bodies matter and why. In doing so we might be better equipped to
imagine or even achieve dlliances among mutants and cyborgs alike.

9. The fact that such gestu rcs nray bc pcrformed by the "wrong" sex suggests that there is no
"right" or "wrong" body hrr any givcn gcnder identity; moreover, that the argument for
"nature" is actuallya politjcal one, tlrc normalization ofsocial control and its violence.
Againstwhat Butler calls a "metaphysics ofsubstance," or the articulation ofgender as a
coherent essence located within the sexed body, gender is instead revealed as a historical
affect of a regulatory heterosexual matrix-or in effect, a technology of the self revealed
as prosthetic. It would be a mistake to conflate performativity (as a modality of power as
discourse or expressivity) with performance (as a deliberate display) in characterizing
acts of cross-identilicat ion.

graduate serninar and following the trial that eventually convicted the first of the
white supremacist men who had brutally murdered black Texan James Byrd lr. I
remember listening to the reports from the courthouse that February; a Pacifica
Pubiic Radio journalist had described the damage done to Byrd's body, seen in au-
topsy photographs, noting the mutilation of his genitals. And in a contemporaneous
letter to a sex-advice columnist that I had read, a white woman narrated her arousal
watching Amistad, visions of buff, black men in chains triggering an erotic fantasyof
bondage and domination. She did not understand why her biack boyfriend would not
rcenact those scenes and wanted to know how she might convince him.

Becoming Digital
February 2019
Shapeshifting
In 2016, Joy Buolamwini, a researcher with the Civic Media group at the MIT Media Lab and founder of Code4Rights, developed the Aspire Mirror. Buolamwini describes the Mirror on its website as a device that allows one to “see a reflection of [their] face based on what inspires [them] or what [they] hope to empathize with.”
The project draws inspiration from Thing From The Future, an imagination card game that asks players to collaboratively and competitively describe objects from a range of alternative futures. The Mirror draws additional influence from futuristic machines and speculative imaginaries found in popular science fiction novels (for instance, the empathy box and mood organ in Phillip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, tales of shape shifting from the Ghanaian tale of the spider Anansi, and movies like Transformers). Buolamwini says she developed the Mirror to induce empathies that can help facilitate the spread of compassion in humanity. Another important goal of the Mirror is to catalyze individual reflection based on a set of cultural values like humility, dedication, oneness with nature, harmony, faith and self-actualization. Ultimately for Buolamwini, these transformative futures are a “hall of possibilities” where individuals can explore self-determinant futures, “if only for a small period of time.”
Aspire Mirror relies on facial detection and tracking software to capture and interpret image data before transforming them into futuristic scenes or “paintings.” During testing, Buolamwini encountered a problem. The Mirror could not detect details of her presence due to her dark skin tones and facial features. In order to validate the device and generate an alternative reality, Buolamwini had to first alter her existing appearance to make herself visible, and gain access to aspirational futures. She accomplished this by wearing a white facial mask, with features that were more easily detected. For Buolamwini, this was no surprise. Buolamwini had encountered this limitation previously, while developing a previous computer vision system.
A brief note on computer vision and machine perception
Computer or machine vision is a broad term used to described methods for processing and analyzing high-dimensional data acquired from the “real” world in order to produce symbolic or numerical outputs. The processed data can then be used to form decisions. Computer vision is powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, and are commonly used for facial and image detection, modelling and aesthetic judgement. It is derived from various bodies of research, including optics, theories of light, surface modelling, as well as auditory analysis. It is used to identify structures using internally represented models of objects previously known to the computer system. These models, usually geometric, find image features that match the model features with the right shape and position. An advantage of this technique is that the model encodes the object shape, thus allowing predictions of image data and lessening the chance of coincidental features being falsely recognized. The primary aim of computer vision is to interpret the visual array to understand objects detected in the environment.
As Brian Potetz and Tai Sing Lee write, computer vision models that infer 3D structures from 2D models are highly complex and underconstrained, requiring many assumptions to infer 3D shape from image points or environmental training data. Little is known about the merits of these assumptions in real scenarios, not to mention there is an awareness that these assumptions must be simplified using probabilistic priors based on real scenes. In fact, exact inference is only possible for a small subclass of potential problems, in which case approximations must be used. Furthermore, Potetz and Lee note that developing human 3D surface perception statistical studies (most often using Bayesian techniques) may uncover entirely new sources of information not immediately obvious from real physical models. They write: “Real scenes are affected by many regularities in the environment, such as the natural geometry of objects, the arrangements of objects in space, natural distributions of light and regularities in the position of the observer.”

While Potetz and Lee see these trends as exploitable in terms of algorithm design, few studies have considered the implication in terms of the model’s own computational reasoning. Here, the model, despite its potential usefulness, maintains an operational perception of irregular and unobservable data to calculate the disparity between probabilistic priors and real scenarios. What would therefore be incomputable and unexplained is instead assigned a function and meaning in terms of the model’s own logics of calculation. In other words, the algorithm assigns a logical potentiality within its perception of distance from the real scenario that is not predetermined, but generative at each iteration. This potentiality exists even though exactly how they will be realized, or how they will become actual, is unknown.
According to Christopher Tyler, these objects, physically consist of aggregates of particles that cohere together to form the object under investigation. Tyler describes the process as such:
    Although the objects may be stable and invariant in the scene before us, the cues that convey the presence of the objects to the eyes are much less stable. They may change in luminance or color, they may be disrupted by reflections or highlights or occlusion by intervening objects. The various cues carrying the information about the physical object structure, such as edge structure, binocular disparity, color, shading, texture, and motion vector fields, typically carry information that is inconsistent.
These algorithmically organized particle structures emphasize an overriding problematic in computer vision research. In order to accomplish what is thought to be visual coherence it is functionally necessary to reduce any inherent levels of inconsistency or instability, as a human eye would. Here, coherence depends heavily on the mitigation of “occlusions” or blockages that may disrupt a clear view of the world around us. In other words, to perceive the world as such, the algorithm must functionally simulate the complexity of, say a human’s optical system, by means of reduction and simplification.
The human eye, for instance, inputs data on a large complex scale through a parallel set of sensory receptors in the retina. Structuring perception through machine architectures is problematic when considering the racialized object. To bring forth a visually coherent future in computer vision, or an incoherent and speculative one for that matter (using Buolamwini’s example), one must first reduce the hall of possibilities to a set of pre-existing conditions. This is inherent in the function of machine perception. While machine perception has been defined in a number of ways (for instance, logics, self-awareness, reasoning, planning, and problem solving), attempts at goal achievement are considered distinct from relative indeterminate human experience. In terms of the former, machine perception functions by stabilizing and simulating environmental phenomenon in order to grasp the fundamental basis of human and other sentient-based actions, mimicking behavior and managing tasks thought to exceed human capabilities. This is seen, most readily, in robotics inspired by the living, both aesthetically and functionally created to solve complex problems thought to be out of reach of most human. Nonetheless, the basis of simulation here characterizes the living as an emanation of pre-existing conditions, reducing the operation of individuation, and primarily the differences amongst the living, to no more than an assemblage of contradictions that are negated and subsumed into a higher, more homogenous, unity of existence.
Beyond reality and the problem of locating known objects
Many coders, like Buolamwini, use pre-written code to perform common computer vision tasks. In the case of Aspire Mirror, this code include libraries such as Beyond Reality Face NXT (NITE XML Toolkit) for face detection and tracking, Vibrant.js for color extraction, jQuery for animation, and Chrome Remote Desktop as a panel control. Beyond Reality Face NXT, for instance, is a cross platform and real time face tracking software development kit (SDK) that marks faces in images and webcam streams. It is a proprietary and downloadable SDK comprised of a collection of resources, such as data, pre-written code, subroutines, classes, values, and type specifications. The NXT analyzes faces using a morphable shape with sixty-eight individual feature points that indicate the eyes, nose, mouth, face, and other details found on the human head. Once the feature points are detected, the NXT estimates the 3D position, rotation and scale of the head, even while the head is in motion. It then uses the tracking data to overlay virtual objects onto images of the detected face. While the complete list of algorithms used in the SDK are proprietary to Tastenkunst, the company that develops the NXT, it is known that the SDK relies on an optimized FPS (framerate) algorithm and an Active Shape Model (ASM) algorithm.
ASMs are algorithms that generate statistical models of the shape of objects in order to conform the suggested shape to the point distribution model. According to Cootes, Taylor, et. al., the developers of Active Shape Algorithms, ASMs are a type of model-based vision algorithm established as an approach to recognizing and locating known objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. The developers argue that while traditional model-based vision algorithms sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, the ASM instead fits the data in ways that are consistent with the training set, allowing the developers to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images within specific contexts determined by the training data.
Regardless, common facial detection libraries are often trained on normalized spectrums of data that are prone to false negatives without proper light conditions. In other words, they are trained on image data that includes primarily white subjects. The white phenotype then becomes the pre-existing condition and the prototypical assemblage from which all future human characteristics are measured. As result, the darker the skin tones or the more variant a person’s phenotypical features are from the average white subject, the less likely the algorithm is to recognize that person’s presence.

While Buolamwini notes that her failed Mirror is telling of the functional limitations of computer vision and machine perception, she argues that the problematic is largely one of representation. For Buolamwini, a failure to recognize black faces as coherent human objects demonstrates “a lack of diversity in the [data] training set [that] leads to an inability to easily characterize faces that do not fit the normal face derived from the training set.”
At the same time she reminds us that ”whoever codes the system embeds her views… limited views create limited systems.”
This “coded gaze,” as she calls it, is a potential catalyst for political action and technical intervention. “Let’s code with a universal gaze,” she writes.
Here it becomes important to foreground Buolamwini’s even unwitting link between black pathology and the technical object, what—in its convergence—we might call the "black technical object." The link I draw here finds precedence in Fanon’s thesis on the operations of race and its impact on the psyche of the racialized. As a practicing psychiatrist, Fanon put forward a line of propositions that extend beyond the corporeal implications of racism into the realm of the psychic and collective individual. For Fanon, the colonial project is an organic system that is demarcated by a series of relations between these individuals and the violent forces of racism. It is essential to note that within these relations, the individual’s psychic fragmentation is made apparent to the individual at the moment of their encounter with racializing phenomena. Returning to Buolamwini’s case, we can think here in terms of the recognition of incompatibility between her own sense of self as a coder and the machine’s functional perception of her as an undetectable, and therefore non-existent, object. Within Fanon’s schema, Buolamwini’s undetectability exaggerates the dissonance between her own self-determination (she just wants to be seen) and the external forces (the Aspire Mirror) that restrict this desire based on a pre-determined set of rules. The possibility of self-determination is opened only under the condition that the individual alters the self, which in this case is a transformation of the flesh.
Fanon’s schema departs from the point of non-existence to discuss the objectification of the individual through this process, which includes their own psychic fragmentation. Consequently, Fanon explains, the individual embodies a phobic image of the self that is infused with paranoia, delirium, and self-doubt. As Fanon describes, the phobic image of the racialized (or what he calls the “photogenic object”) is embedded in the psychic orientation of the West.
Within these imaginary systems, self-doubt becomes the guiding principle by which the racialized person views themselves as well as the world around them. These affective relations are felt and acted on, effectively replacing what is actually seen with a fictive belief about how one should perceive the photogenic object. While the white psychic structure experiences the same phobia, according to Fanon, it is instead articulated as a social incompatibility or threat, where the racialized become visible as individual beings only in as much as their possibility for existence aligns with pre-existing concepts of racial hierarchy. Fanon writes: “For the object, naturally, need not be there, it is enough that somewhere it exist: It is a possibility.”If we are to consider the photogenic object in contemporary spaces of algorithmic culture, it is apparent that the black technical object is always-already pre-conditioned by an affective prelogic of race that functions on the psychic level of experience. The possibility of an affirmative engagement between the black technical object and the algorithm, as a technical object, is then limited by the necessity to reconcile the psychic potential of the racialized individual with that of a pre-determined technical structure. Although the immediacy of computation’s lack of diversity—in terms of institutional value and algorithmic function—cannot be understated, a call to make black technical objects compatible to computer vision algorithms risks the further reduction of the lived potentiality of black individuals. While the achievement of Buolamwini’s aims might widen the scope of machine perception, not to mention the participation of excluded bodies in techno-social ecologies, the solution, as proposed, reinforces the presupposition that coherence and detectability are necessary components of human-techno relations. The drive towards uniform coherence works to circumvent any substantial consideration of the algorithm’s reliance on historical category —namely, what features represent the categories of human, gender, race, sexuality, and so on. Coders like Buolamwini speak directly to this problem of the erasure, yet fold seamlessly into the desire for representation. “Challenged to rethink, insurgent black intellectuals and/or artists are looking at new ways to write and talk about race and representation, working to transform the image,” as bell.hooks writes.
hooks reminds us, however, that:
    There is a direct and abiding connection between the maintenance of white supremacist patriarchy in this society and the institutionalization via … specific images, representations of race, of blackness that support and maintain the oppression, exploitation, and overall domination of all black people… For it is only as one imagines “woman” in the abstract, when woman becomes fiction or fantasy, can race not be seen as significant.
Still, hooks is quick to remind us that the institutionalization and drive towards representation are devoid of the dynamisms of black life:
    For some time now the critical challenge for black folks has been to expand the discussion of race and representation beyond debates about good and bad imagery. Often what is thought to be good is merely a reaction against representations created by white people that were blatantly stereotypical. Currently, however, we are bombarded by black folks creating and marketing similar stereotypical images. It is not an issue of “us” and “them.” The issue is really one of standpoint.
In terms of computation, following hooks, we are immediately drawn to the problematic of black representation and algorithmic calculation. By regressing complex environmental data into a generalized pattern, the lived and multivalent specificities of black lives are represented “as if” the visual matrix maintains no connections to historical category, stereotype, or a moral imaginary. It further highlights a commitment within research to organize certain life in accordance with the rules of occlusion, which already necessitates a presupposition of object relation (in terms of the black face, that which is brought into view only in as much as it can make sense of the world in relation to the white body).
The consequences for the black technical object are immense. An undetectable black technical object is, in this instance, equivalent to what I call a "machinic non-existence," or the formation of an empirical reality that—as Sylvia Wynter articulates in her critique of Western humanism—is a projection of a racialized substance that is metaphysically sustained by the Aristotelian embodiment of normalcy.
Put another way, research in computation is an adaptation of the fictive and compulsive ordering of human attributes into a single coherent image of species, or what Wynter has described as “being secularly human.” Wynter draws on Judith Butler’s critique of gender, where Butler argues that Otherness emerges when we enact the nouns "man" and "woman" as abiding substances. Butler states that these substances are produced by the fictive and compulsive ordering of attributes into a coherent gender sequence. If these coherences are nothing more than “contingently created through the regulation of attributes,” then Butler posits that any ontology of substance is itself an “artificial effect.”
Wynter’s adoption of this point of reference extends the artificiality of regulated attributes into the substances of class, sexual orientation, and race.
Her claim is prompted by the creation of what she describes as eugenic/dysgenic selection.
The conditions for racial sorting and priority were already set forth in the establishment of data analytics and statistical correlation as viable tools for social inquiry. In many ways, the limits of calculation cannot be understood outside of the connection between racial sorting, social welfare, and quantification. We can think of this relation as illustrative of what Ian Hacking describes as “enduring ways of thinking” that have impacted philosophical understandings of mathematics. For instance, Hacking uses A.C. Crombie’s text Philosophical Presuppositions and Shifting Interpretations of Galileo as an example of the reliance on “(a) the simple postulation and deduction in the mathematical sciences, (b) experimental exploration, (c) hypothetical construction of models of analogy, (d) ordering of variety by comparison and taxonomy, (e) statistical analysis of regularities of populations, and (f) historical derivation of genetic development.”
He highlights these paradigms to note an important shift in social frameworks that increasingly rely upon reasoning to establish scientific method. This matrix of knowledge production, as Hacking argues, has given rise to the false idea that information on population phenomena can be accurately evaluated through symbolic sampling, as opposed to the exhaustive census work that had been attempted prior.
These techniques were amplified by the work of Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet and André-Michel Guerry. Quetelet and Gerry hypothesized that independent human phenomena behaved with the certainty of astronomical phenomena—a process that simulated the rotation of the Earth around the Sun.
As result, human behavior was bound to astronomical causality, as universal constants. As with the stars, any deviations from derived human constants of behavior were deduced as perturbations to naturalized events that, once settled back into an equilibrium, could be returned to previously normalized patterns. In other words, the hypothesis aligned contingent and chaotic phenomena with a statistical order. The data, however, were actionable in their capacity to infer future social behavior based on historical and present observation. From these technologies, prototypical behavior emerged as a mode of population control, mediated through what German mathematician Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss termed the homme type, or the “average man.”
Quetelet's primary emphasis was on the codification of phenotypical phenomena, particularly race, in as much as race is extends beyond the biological and into moral substance. Hacking writes:
    Where before one thought of a people in terms of its culture or its geography or its language or its rulers or its religion, Quetelet introduced a new objective measurable conception of a people. A race would be characterized by its measurements of physical and moral qualities, summed up in the average man of that race. This is half of the beginnings of eugenics, the other half being the reflection that one can introduce social policies that will either preserve or alter the average qualities of a race. In short, the average man led to both a new kind of information about populations and a new conception of how to control them.
Here, Quetelet uses basic statistical probabilities to construct a matrix of phenotypical characteristics. Interestingly, he had little interest in deriving numerical averages of phenotypical factors such as height and weight (this would be the equivalent of preempting an individual’s rate of childbirth at 2.2 children or that an individual might marry 1.6 times). The primary function of the matrix is to identify a causal relationship between an array of unique, yet arbitrary, properties, such as human chest size to vegetable harvest, poetry, and moral attributes.
Using the logics of astronomical discovery, Quetelet hypothesized that any departures from normalized patterns of hereditary development were disruptions in the natural trajectory of evolution. More so, he believed these differences would (or could) be naturally de-selected. Alternatively, any conformity to normalized attributes would be naturally selected for both survival and superiority among its species. As Hacking writes:
    Quetelet had made mean stature, eye-color, artistic faculty and disease into real quantities. Once he had done that … deviation from the means was just natural deviation, deviation made by nature, and that could not be conceived of as errors.
In terms of computer vision, the site of exclusion in Aspire Mirror is also the precise moment where the black technical object is interpellated, fragmented and organized around the white visual metaphor. The coherence of racialized attributes, what I could furthermore call the "fictive substance of race," links the dynamic instrumentalization of coherence found in computation to the “discursive negation of co-humaness.”
The negation immediately enacts a pre-existent distance between the perception of oneself as a self-determinant being and a more formative system of abstract value. In other words, black life as such, or black being-as-being-self-constituted is at a continued distance from the illusionary prototypical image. What is one to do?
To merely include a representational object into a computational milieu that has already positioned the white object as the prototypical characteristic catalyzes disruption on the level superficiality. From this view, the white object remains whole, while the object of difference is seen as alienated, fragmented, and lacking in comparison. From this perspective, the position of the black technical object (as Fanon and Wynter have thoroughly articulated) is lodged in a recurrent dialectic, where it attempts to valorize or recapture black life from within the confines of normalized logics while simultaneously desiring to disrupt its hold. Can the black technical object be conceptualized as outside of the dialectic between human and machine? Is there such a thing, borrowing from Fred Moten, as an aspirational black life that can gain a right of refusal to representation? As such, would a universal computational gaze limit the self-determination of those that have little or no desire for inclusion in machine perception? Alternatively, as facial recognition becomes an increasingly important lens through which we understand the world, how can black technical objects generate new possibilities outside of phenotypical calculation, prototypical correlation, and the generalization of category? How might we create a more affirmative view of the relation between the black technical object and technology?
Perceptive unities
It is apparent that the immediacy of these concerns mirror the intensity at which computer vision is populated in the public domain. Recent debates surrounding data, artificial intelligence and machine learning as a techno-human practice, particularly in terms of the discriminatory powers of classification and further reductions in the life chances of marginalized populations, have raised significant questions concerning the logics of machine perception and its impact on the self-actualization of black potential. Most significant is a disparity between the act of existing/existence—particularly as it relates to differential human states of being (categories of race, gender, sexuality, and so on)—and the paradigms of epistemological operation. The result is no less real than the metaphysical gestures algorithms seek to appropriate, such as conflict resolution, discovery, compatibility and invention. Any solution to the complexity of the relation between black individuals and algorithms is only exacerbated by an over-dependence on mathematics as truth, and that which already exists in computation as fact—particularly in circumstances such as police surveillance or managerial oversight, where face detection reaches beyond the exploration of aspirations toward the operative reduction of life chances.
Recent trials conducted by the London Metropolitan Police Service (The Met) enact similar logics of perception. In 2018, The Met invited Christmas shoppers in Central London to take part in a trial of a facial detection system used to identify suspects wanted by the police. To trial the system, The Met mapped existing police image data onto the software. Once trained, the algorithm interacts with cameras at the specific location. The camera scans faces in the crowd, feeding the image data captured back into the algorithm. The algorithm then compares the captured image data and correlates it to image representations (suspects) flagged by the police. Data representations of the Christmas crowd are kept in the police database for weeks.
The Met’s festive trial is part of a larger investigation into the use of facial detection software to identify criminal suspects. However, these attempts have been met with scrutiny in terms of privacy (officers are instructed to wear plain clothes), and also the robustness of the system. An investigation by campaign group Big Brother Watch indicates an alarming number of false positives. For example, in The Met’s trial at London's Notting Hill carnival in 2016 and 2017, the system incorrectly flagged 102 people as potential suspects. All led to no arrests. This is in addition to data acquired from the South Wales Police that shows 2,451 false positives out of 2,685 so-called “matches.”
Facial detection operations are not limited to blind trials. They are employed to solve a range of economic, social or political objectives which rely on a greater coherence of individuals and the environment for operational efficiency. For instance, an online retailer may desire to increase sales by identifying which of its present or future customers are likely to purchase certain goods or not; or when, if ever, they are likely to make a present or future purchase. A bank may want to gain a deeper understanding of its client base to determine which customers are most likely to default on a loan or credit card agreement. Once correlated, these customers can then be classified by risk and given either higher or lower interest rates. A judicial committee concerned with recidivism may want to make parole decisions based on the probability a convicted person will become a repeat offender. Or, a police agency may attempt to optimize the distribution of police cruisers based on the probability a neighborhood will yield lower crime rates based on police presence. Here, the notion of objectivity is once again challenged, bringing forth what Ezekiel Dixon-Román terms "algo-ritmo," or the disciplining of the flesh. Dixon-Román writes:
    Regardless of the degree of human subjectivity behind the code for this algorithm, it is the case that the performative act of this algorithm can be a powerful force in shaping and disciplining the flesh. In this example, algo-ritmo quite explicitly disciplines the flesh and designates humanity into full humans and nonhumans… As an immanent act beyond human intervention, algo-ritmo is a performative force that may do more than simply reify “difference.” With the ubiquity of algorithms in society, algo-ritmo has the capacity to reconfigure the boundaries of “difference” as well as further magnify the sedimentation of “difference.”
Dixon-Román points to the act of classification as not only the reification of difference, but also the re-configuration of the ontologies of the human in relation to technology. In these instances, the process of computer vision begins at the presupposition by the human perceiver that the machine has already attained a state of objectification independent of the variability human experience and knowledge. Problematics are compounded when technological research collides with public trust/distrust in data and automated systems that organize the complex realities of human relations. While the technologies illuminate sentient and computational concerns, they also unearth human-machine phenomenon that might otherwise remain hidden or obscured from vision. In this way, machine learners are as much relational as they are operative in the shaping of perception “as if” they are direct simulations of sentient intelligences—as illustrated in desires for more “natural” or sentient-like behaviors in speech generation/recognition, robotics, and artificial intelligences.
In this sense, computer vision becomes an act of thought that privileges the view that individuals are created on the basis of coherence and categorical division. In this way, the relation between human reason and artificiality emerges as an immediate contradiction of perceptual domains. While one—the human—is based on a multivalent array of lived realities, the other is founded in a nominalism devoid of dynamism. This astonishing circumvention of indeterminacy naturalizes and objectifies the variant ways in which human beings live their lives to a degree that any mode of coexistence becomes no more than a transcendental presence brought forth by a single epistemological point of view. The operation of individuation is furthermore relegated to a series of representations amongst a falsely unified species. The consequence is the “freezing” of dynamic life into a homogenous milieu, and the immediate suppression of the lived conditions that catalyze certain individual transformations and subsequently inform future iterations of being.
We are, in Merleau-Ponty’s view, relational beings: life “has a social atmosphere just as much as it has a flavor of mortality.”
Yet, by bringing forth the fictive substance of race into the realm of the artificial, machine perception functions as a series of “rudimental navigations,” using Johanna Seibt’s description, that operate under the logics of rule-based procedures, “as if” they are human. If machine perception is to mimic anything other than pre-existing hylemorphic association, then we must take into account that the machine is not human. The artificial cannot comprehend the full scope of life and human existence. It is through the rule-based procedure, the substance, that the machine maintains both its dependence on limits of metaphysics and the objectification of life itself. These demands are in addition to what Seibt argues is a “gradual increase of the regulatory dependence up to normativity.” Here, multivalent human perception is not enlisted to widen our understanding of ourselves or the world around us, but is instead of value to research only in as much it can assist in the demonstration of what machines can or cannot do.
The current ontological position, she argues, can be described more precisely as tendencies to place value on the knowing how of knowledge production as a process dependent upon the formulation of description in conversation with normative modes of performance. I quote Seibt at length:
    From a philosophical viewpoint it is a category mistake to assume that we can interact with anything—whether robot or human—as if it were a person. “Person” is not a descriptive predicate designating a feature, but a declarative-ascriptive predicate designing a response-dependent condition like “red” or “C#,” with the distinctive difference that the response to the item in question is not perceptual but normative— it is undertaking a commitment to certain actions and omissions, in accordance with rights and obligations… When we call an entity a person we thereby, in the performance of that utterance, take on certain absolute normative commitments—in fact, to call something a person is to do nothing else but to make these commitments… You cannot say “It is as if I hereby promise you…” nor “I promise you somewhat…” Similarly, if we treat some x as a person we are committed to taking x as a person, which means that we interact with x as a person.
The role of normativity then, in its increased tendency to drive the production of normality, undertakes new significances in ethical debates surrounding the applications of artificial intelligence systems. At risk is the continued (re)production of the categorical other and the foreclosure of the lived conditions through which specific humans might determine if a machine is friend, foe, colleague, or neighbor. Luciana Parisi has shown that the “actualities that select, evaluate, transform, and produce data” expose the internal inconsistencies of rational-based systems, particularly functional mechanisms that advocate for the naturalization of reason.
Her argument calls into question the fundamental logic of the rule-based procedure and offers new opportunities to re-assess the question of what actualities count as processes of artificial reason.
Without a wider scope, debates on these matters remain incomplete in their characterization of algorithmic prejudices and social discriminations. Attempts at reconciling this arguably unsettled debate rely on a commitment to sufficiently characterize the constitution of a more affirmative process of machinic existence that can gain a totality in relation to artificial modes of perception. The proposal asks us to consider what is overlooked in machine perception, and in doing so dislodge both the ontological and functional process of machine perception from its roots in substantialist metaphysics. Machine perception here demands a new reflexive position that can generate alternative levels of operation. As Robert Brandom reminds us: “Description [becomes] classification with consequences, either immediately practical (‘to be discarded/examined/kept’) or for further classification.”
Affirmative psychic genesis
A revision of this field of perception demands a return to metaphysics and a reading of the genesis of being from the perspective of multivalent modes of reality. Although artificial systems are based on classification and descriptions, with tendencies of revision and prediction, there are other modes of logic that ontology has under-articulated. Whereas Siebt proposes a technological solution that can account for languages that do not contain terms for “human mental states, agentive goals, or social relations,” Stefano Harney and Fred Moten suggest that we imagine an ontological relation that prioritizes the psychic generation of the black technical object. Within this framework, we are asked to give thought to the black technical object that does not “want to be correct” or “corrected”:
    Consider the following statement: "There's nothing wrong with blackness": What if this were the primitive axiom of a new black studies underived from the psycho-politico-pathology of populations and its corollary theorization of the state or of state racism; an axiom derived, as all such axioms are, from the “runaway tongues” and eloquent vulgarities encrypted in works and days that turn out to be of the native or the slave only insofar as the fugitive is misrecognized, and in bare lives that turn out to be bare only insofar as no attention is paid to them, only insofar as such lives persist under the sign and weight of a closed question?
Here, we can imagine an object that develops an indifference to description or any other form of artificial representation. It would maintain its lived experience as such, as an internal transformation, both within and in excess of artificial perception. The act of psychological transformation, here, challenges the state of homogeneity by engaging in a transformative politics of affirmative self belonging.
Harney and Moten develop their understanding of the transformative subject by suggesting that the individual viewed as not belonging is represented as a type of cultural entropy within dominant systems of power. However, this “hidden” individual is only excess insofar as it operates from the viewpoint of lack or decay. Harney and Moten argue that within the experience of social contact, what bell.hooks might call a “communion,” the entropic individual exceeds the barriers of social relations to enter an alternative space of becoming—made possible by a reimagining of the self. In other words, allowability for the unusable, uncommon, and thus incomputable individual potentializes the social space toward new ways of relating.
If, as Moten argues in “The Case of Blackness,” that ‘the cultural and political discourse on black pathology has been so pervasive that it could be said to constitute the background against which all representations of blacks, blackness, or (the color) black take place,” then how might the pathological dulling of black life inform new readings of computer vision? What would it take to resist notions of universal correlations, and instead value the dissonance that emerges in relation with analytics?
By prioritising cohesion, algorithmic processes erode the potential for human difference and self-actualization. Coherence gives rise to what Deleuze and Guattari call the "demands of singularity," or an insistence on the union of diverse entities into a single group, form, body, or relation. In “Nomadology: The War Machine,” Deleuze and Guattari remind us that “the model in question is one of becoming and heterogeneity, as opposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical, the constant.”
The black technical object converges with the artificial in an assemblage of mutable and multivalent experiences. Here, both the black technical object and technical object inform each iteration of themselves in a self-governing system of feedback.
While entities within the assemblage might be perceived as incompatible, new conditions for self-actualization emerge at each moment of contact. In other words, the black sense of self is formed, informed, and reformed at the moment of dissonance between self-perception and any externally-constructed view of black life. These tensions are the conditions from which new iterations of the self are generated, which exceed the reductions of representation and visibility. They form a recurrent system of feedback, that enact what Foucault has called a technologies of the self, which "permit[s] individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection or immortality."
By prioritizing difference, entropy (or the loss of computational coherence as such) can be conceptualized as the condition through which transformation is made possible. In this way, entropy is revealed to a system inclusive of contingency, instability, multivalent modes of perceptions, indeterminacies, and iterations of self-actualization.
If we accept the present matrix of computer vision as a normalizing logics, then perhaps we should turn away from our dependencies on the artificial to activate the internal halls of possibilities that pre-exist in human potentiality. The concerns that arise from within our parasitic relation with the technical object are no less immediate, as artificial intelligences such as computer vision articulate a wider logic of reductionism and black exclusion. What we experience today as algorithmic prejudice is the materialization of an overriding logic of correlation and hierarchy hidden under the illusion of objectivity. Meanwhile, the fictive substances of race and racialization work to disrupt self-actualization by re-enforcing the false assumption of coherence. In the drive towards coherence, computer vision is set in place “as if” it is human and the guardian of judgement. In operation, it is assigned the role of interpellator, assigning value (in terms of visibility) to the individual only in as much as he/she/they can be measured against a universalizing concept of being. In the collision between blackness and the artificial, this operation can materialize, even unwittingly, as an incoherence, which places undue weight on the perception of oneself and environment. While this perception speaks to the immediacy of racism and racialization, an opportunity emerges to shift the pathological perspective from one of entropy and lack to a more affirmative process of psychic generation. Here, the development of a machinic existence would, at its origin, substitute the view of computational duress to one of black totality, always already in the process of transformation. The resultant incompatibility could then be seen as an act that, while bringing forth pre-existing substances of racialization, can make use of this duress to catalyst future affirmative iterations of the self. Ultimately, what is prioritized within this psychic encounter is a compassion for the self as already coherent at the encounter of artificial misrecognition—a self that is continually taking shape, as blackness has always done, in its exploration of infinite halls of possibility.

This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.
This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These are just some examples of mechanisms of classification that the personal and trace data we generate is subject to every day in network-connected, advanced capitalist societies. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and lately on machine learning algorithms to do this work.
Opacity seems to be at the very heart of new concerns about ‘algorithms’ among legal scholars and social scientists. The algorithms in question operate on data. Using this data as input, they produce an output; specifically, a classification (i.e. whether to give an applicant a loan, or whether to tag an email as spam). They are opaque in the sense that if one is a recipient of the output of the algorithm (the classification decision), rarely does one have any concrete sense of how or why a particular classification has been arrived at from inputs. Additionally, the inputs themselves may be entirely unknown or known only partially. The question naturally arises, what are the reasons for this state of not knowing? Is it because the algorithm is proprietary? Because it is complex or highly technical? Or are there, perhaps, other reasons?
By distinguishing forms of opacity that are often conflated in the emerging interdisciplinary scholarship on this topic, I seek to highlight the varied implications of algorithmic classification for longstanding matters of concern to sociologists, such as economic inequality and social mobility. Three distinct forms of opacity include: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or institutional self-protection and concealment and, along with it, the possibility for knowing deception; (2) opacity stemming from the current state of affairs where writing (and reading) code is a specialist skill and; (3) an opacity that stems from the mismatch between mathematical optimization in high-dimensionality characteristic of machine learning and the demands of human-scale reasoning and styles of semantic interpretation. This third form of opacity (often conflated with the second form as part of the general sense that algorithms and code are very technical and complex) is the particular focus of this article. By examining in depth this form of opacity I point out shortcomings in certain proposals for code or algorithm ‘audits’ as a way to evaluate for discriminatory classification.
To examine this question of opacity, specifically toward the task of getting inside the algorithms themselves, I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight audit. Along the way, I relate these forms of opacity to technical and non-technical solutions proposed to address the impenetrability of machine learning classification. Each form suggests distinct solutions for preventing harm.
So, what is new?
The word algorithm has recently undergone a shift in public presentation, going from an obscure technical term used almost exclusively among computer scientists, to one attached to a polarized discourse. The term appears increasingly in mainstream media outlets. For example, the professional body National Nurses United produced a radio spot (heard on a local radio station by the author) that starts with a voice that sarcastically declares, “algorithms are simple mathematical formulas that nobody understands” and concludes with a nurse swooping in to rescue a distressed patient from a disease diagnosis system which makes a series of comically wrong declarations about the patient’s condition.1 The purpose of the public service announcement (PSA) is to champion professional care (by nurses), in this case against error-prone automation. By contrast, efforts at corporate ‘branding’ of the term algorithm play up notions of algorithmic objectivity over biased human decision-making (Sandvig, 2015). In this way the connotations of the term are actively being shaped as part of advertising culture and corporate self-presentation, as well as challenged by a related counter-discourse tied to general concerns about automation, corporate accountability, and media monopolies (i.e. Tufekci, 2014).
While these new media narratives may be novel, it has long been the case that large organizations (including private sector firms and public institutions) have had internal procedures that were not fully understood to those who were subject to them. These procedures could fairly be described as ‘algorithms'. What should we then make of these new uses of the term and the field of critique and analysis emerging along with it? Is this merely ‘old wine in new bottles’ or are there genuinely new and pressing issues related to patterns of algorithmic design as they are employed increasingly in real-world applications?
In addition to the polarization of a public discourse about algorithms, much of what is new in this domain is the more pervasive technologies and techniques of data collection, the more vast archives of personal data including purchasing activities, link clicks, and geospatial movement, an outcome of more universally adopted mobile devices, services, and applications and the reality (in some parts of the world) of constant connectivity. But this does not necessarily have much to do with the algorithms that operate on the data. Often it is about what composes the data and new concerns about privacy and the possibility (or troublingly, the impossibility) of opting-out.
Other changes have to do with particular application areas and evolving proposals for a regulatory response. The shift of algorithmic automation into new areas of what were previously white-collar work reflected in headlines like, ‘will we need teachers or algorithms?’2 and into consequential processes of classification that were previously human-determined, such as credit evaluations in an effort to realize cost-savings (as so often fuels shifts toward automation) (Straka, 2000). In the domain of credit and lending, Fourcade and Healy point to a shift from prior practices of exclusionary lending to a select few, to more generous credit offered to a broader spectrum of society, but offered to some on unfavorable, even usurious terms. This shift is made possible by ‘the emergence and expansion of methods of tracking and classifying consumer behavior’ (Fourcade and Healy, 2013: 560). These methods are (in part) implemented as algorithms in computers. Here the account seems to suggest an expansion of the territory of work claimed by particular algorithmic routines, that they are taking on a broader range of types of tasks at a scale that they were not previously.
In this emerging critique of ‘algorithms’ carried out by scholars in law and in the social sciences, few have considered in much depth their mathematical design. Many of these critics instead take a broad socio-technical approach looking at ‘algorithms in the wild.’ The algorithms in question are studied for the way they are situated within a corporation, under the pressure of profit and shareholder value, and as they are applied to particular real-world user populations (and the data these populations produce). Thus something more than the algorithmic logic is being examined. Such analyses are often particular to an implementation (such as Google’s search engine) with its specific user base and uniquely accumulated history of problems and failures with resulting parameter setting and manual tweaking by programmers. Such an approach may not surface important broader patterns or risks to be found in particular classes of algorithms.
Investigating opacity: A method and approach
In general, we cannot look at the code directly for many important algorithms of classification that are in widespread use. This opacity (at one level) exists because of proprietary concerns. They are closed in order to maintain competitive advantage and/or to keep a few steps ahead of adversaries. Adversaries could be other companies in the market or malicious attackers (relevant in many network security applications). However, it is possible to investigate the general computational designs that we know these algorithms use by drawing from educational materials.
To do this I draw, in part, from classic illustrative examples of particular machine learning models, of the sort used in undergraduate education. In this case I have specifically examined programming assignments for a Coursera course in machine learning. These examples offer hugely simplified versions of computational ideas scaled down to run on a student’s personal computer so that they return output almost immediately. Such examples do not force a confrontation with many thorny, real-world application challenges. That said, the ways that opacity endures in spite of such simplification reveal something important and fundamental about the limits to overcoming it.
Machine learning algorithms do not encompass all of the algorithms of interest to scholars now studying what might be placed under the banner of the ‘politics of algorithms.’3 However, they are interesting to consider specifically because they are typically applied to classification tasks and because they are used to make socially consequential predictions such as ‘how likely is this loan applicant to default?’ In the broader domain of algorithms implemented in various areas of concern (such as search engines or credit scoring) machine learning algorithms may play either a central or a peripheral role and it is not always easy to tell which is the case. For example, a search engine request is algorithmically driven,4 but search engine algorithms are not at their core ‘machine learning’ algorithms. Search engines employ machine learning algorithms for particular purposes, such as detecting ads or blatant search ranking manipulation and prioritizing search results based on the user’s location.5
While not all tasks that machine learning is applied to are classification tasks, this is a key area of application and one where many sociological concerns arise. As Bowker and Star note in their account of classification and its consequences, ‘each category valorizes some point of view and silences another’ and there is a long history of lives ‘broken, twisted, and torqued by their encounters with classification systems’ such as the race classification system of apartheid South Africa and the categorization of tuberculosis patients, as they detail (Bowker and Star, 1999). The claim that algorithms will classify more ‘objectively’ (thus solving previous inadequacies or injustices in classification) cannot simply be taken at face value given the degree of human judgment still involved in designing the algorithms, choices which become built-in. This human work includes defining features, pre-classifying training data, and adjusting thresholds and parameters.
Opacity
Below I define a typology starting first with the matter of ‘opacity’ as a form of proprietary protection or as ‘corporate secrecy’ (Pasquale, 2015). Secondly, I point to opacity in terms of the readability of code. Code writing is a necessary skill for the computational implementation of algorithms, and one that remains a specialist skill not found widely in the general public. Finally, arriving at the major point of this article, I contrast a third form of opacity centering on the mismatch between mathematical procedures of machine learning algorithms and human styles of semantic interpretation. At the heart of this challenge is an opacity that relates to the specific techniques used in machine learning. Each of these forms of opacity may be tackled by different tools and approaches ranging from the legislative, to the organizational or programmatic, to the technical. But importantly, the form (or forms) of opacity entailed in a particular algorithmic application must be identified in order to pursue a course of action that is likely to mitigate its problems.
Forms of opacity
Opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy
One argument in the emerging literature on the ‘politics of algorithms’ is that algorithmic opacity is a largely intentional form of self-protection by corporations intent on maintaining their trade secrets and competitive advantage. Yet this is not just about one search engine competing with another to keep their ‘secret sauce’ under wraps. It is also the case that dominant platforms and applications, particularly those that use algorithms for ranking, recommending, trending, and filtering, attract those who want to ‘game’ them as part of strategies for securing attention from the general public. The field of ‘search engine optimization’ does just this. An approach within machine learning called ‘adversarial learning’ deals specifically with these sorts of evolving strategies. Network security applications of machine learning deal explicitly with spam, scams, and fraud and remain opaque in order to be effective. Sandvig notes that this ‘game of cat-and-mouse’ makes it entirely unlikely that most algorithms will be (or necessarily should be) disclosed to the general public (Sandvig et al., 2014: 9). That said, an obvious alternative to proprietary and closed algorithms is open source software. Successful business models have emerged out of the open source movement. There are options even in ‘adversarial learning’ such as the SpamAssassin spam filter for Apache.
On the other hand, Pasquale’s more skeptical analysis proposes that the current extent of algorithmic opacity in many domains of application may not be justified and is instead a product of lax or lagging regulations. In his book The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms that Control Money and Information he argues that a kind of adversarial situation is indeed in play, one where the adversary is regulation itself. ‘What if financiers keep their doings opaque on purpose, precisely to avoid or to confound regulation?’ he asks (Pasquale, 2015: 2). In reference to this, he defines ‘opacity’ as ‘remediable incomprehensibility.’
The opacity of algorithms, according to Pasquale, could be attributed to willful self-protection by corporations in the name of competitive advantage, but this could also be a cover for a new form of concealing sidestepped regulations, the manipulation of consumers, and/or patterns of discrimination.
For this type of opacity, one proposed response is to make code available for scrutiny, through regulatory means if necessary (Diakopoulos, 2013; Gandy, 2010; Pasquale, 2015). Underlying this particular explanation for algorithmic opacity is an assumption that if corporations were willing to expose the design of the algorithms they use, it would be possible to ascertain problems of consumer manipulation or regulatory violation by reading the code. Pasquale acknowledges that such measures could render algorithms ineffective though suggests that it may still be possible with the use of an independent, ‘trusted auditor’ who can maintain secrecy while serving the public interest (Pasquale, 2015: 141). In the absence of access to the code, Sandvig et al. (2014) detail and compare several forms of algorithmic audit (carried out with or without corporate cooperation) as a possible response, a way of forcing the issue without requiring access to the code itself.
Opacity as technical illiteracy
This second level of opacity stems from an acknowledgement that, at present, writing (and reading) code and the design of algorithms is a specialized skill. It remains inaccessible to the majority of the population. Courses in software engineering emphasize the writing of clean, elegant, and intelligible code. While code is implemented in particular programming languages, such as C or Python, and the syntax of these languages must be learned, they are in certain ways quite different from human languages. For one, they adhere strictly to logical rules and require precision in spelling and grammar in order to be ‘read’ by the machine.
Good code does double-duty. It must be interpretable by humans (the original programmer or someone adding to or maintaining the code) as well as by the computational device (Mateas and Montfort, 2005). Writing for the computational device demands a special exactness, formality, and completeness that communication via human languages does not. The art and ‘craft’6 of programming is partly about managing this mediating role and entails some well-known ‘best practices’ like choosing sensible variable names, including ‘comments’ (one-sided communication to human programmers omitted when the code is compiled for the machine), and choosing the simpler code formulation, all things being equal.
Recent calls for greater diversity in STEM fields and for general efforts toward developing ‘computational thinking’ at all levels of education (Lee et al., 2011; Wing, 2006) are relevant. Diakopoulos (2013) likewise suggests ways that journalists might play a valuable role in reverse engineering algorithms to inform the general public, but notes that this poses a challenge of ‘human resource’ development, one of developing code and computational literacy in journalists or others who wish to do this sort of examination. To address this form of opacity, widespread educational efforts would ideally make the public more knowledgeable about these mechanisms that impact their life opportunities and put them in a better position to directly evaluate and critique them.
Opacity as the way algorithms operate at the scale of application
Scholars have noted that algorithms (such as that underlying the Google search engine) are often multi-component systems built by teams producing an opacity that programmers who are ‘insiders’ to the algorithm must contend with as well (Sandvig et al., 2014; Seaver, 2014). A call for code ‘audits’ (where this means reading the code) and the employment of ‘auditors’ may underestimate what this would entail as far as the number of hours required to untangle the logic of the code within a complicated software system. This valid critique is nevertheless non-specific about different classes of algorithms and their particular logics.
I further argue that there are certain challenges of scale and complexity that are distinctive to machine learning algorithms. These challenges relate not simply to total number of lines or pages of code, the number of team members on the engineering team, and the multitude of interlinkages between modules or subroutines. These are challenges not just of reading and comprehending code, but being able to understand the algorithm in action, operating on data. Though a machine learning algorithm can be implemented simply in such a way that its logic is almost fully comprehensible, in practice, such an instance is unlikely to be particularly useful. Machine learning models that prove useful (specifically, in terms of the ‘accuracy’ of classification) possess a degree of unavoidable complexity.
Machine learning in particular is often described as suffering from the ‘curse of dimensionality’ (Domingos, 2012). In a ‘Big Data’ era, billions or trillions of data examples and thousands or tens of thousands of properties of the data (termed ‘features’ in machine learning) may be analyzed. The internal decision logic of the algorithm is altered as it ‘learns’ on training data. Handling a huge number especially of heterogeneous properties of data (i.e. not just words in spam email, but also email header info) adds complexity to the code. Machine learning techniques quickly face computational resource limits as they scale and may manage this, using techniques written into the code (such as ‘principal component analysis’) which add to its opacity. While datasets may be extremely large but possible to comprehend and code may be written with clarity, the interplay between the two in the mechanism of the algorithm is what yields the complexity (and thus opacity). Better understanding this complexity (and the barriers to overcoming the opacity it effects) is the concern of the following examples.
Machine learning: A very brief primer
Machine learning algorithms are used as powerful generalizers and predictors. Since the accuracy of these algorithms is known to improve with greater quantities of data to train on, the growing availability of such data in recent years has brought renewed interest to these algorithms.
A given machine learning algorithm generally includes two parallel operations, or two distinct algorithms: a ‘classifier’ and a ‘learner’ (see, for example, Figure 3). Classifiers take input (referred to as a set of ‘features’) and produce an output (a ‘category’). For example, a classifier that does spam filtering takes a set of features (such as email header information, words in the body of the email, etc.) and produces one of two output categories (‘spam’ or ‘not spam’). A decision support system that does disease diagnosis may take input (clinical presentation/symptoms, blood test results) and produce a disease diagnosis as output (‘hypertension,’ ‘heart disease,’ ‘liver cancer’). However, machine learning algorithms called ‘learners’ must first train on test data.7 The result of this training is a matrix of weights that will then be used by the classifier to determine the classification for new input data. This training data could, for example, be emails that have been pre-sorted and labeled as ‘spam’ or ‘not spam.’
Machine learning encompasses a number of models that are implemented in code in different ways. Some popular machine learning models include neural networks, decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and logistic regression. The choice of model depends upon the domain (i.e. loan default prediction vs. image recognition), its demonstrated accuracy in classification, and available computational resources, among other concerns. Models may also be combined into ‘model ensembles,’ an approach often used in machine learning competitions that seek to maximize accuracy in classification. Two applications of machine learning using separate models will be considered below.
Visualizing opacity in a neural network
The first model and application of machine learning I wish to consider is a ‘neural network’ applied to an image recognition task. Because this is an image recognition task, it lends itself to an attempt to ‘see’ the weights output by the training algorithm. The classic example for teaching neural networks to computer science undergraduates is handwriting recognition.8 To simplify the computational task for educational purposes, the code is implemented to recognize handwritten digits only (the numbers 0 through 9). To further simply the task, these digits are drawn within the boundaries of a space-constrained box. Viewing Figure 1 you can see some of the ‘fuzziness’ and ambiguity of the data that is to be classified. If you take a single handwritten number in an 8 × 8 pixel square, each pixel (and a grayscale value associated with it) becomes an input (or ‘feature’) to the classifier which ultimately outputs what number it recognizes (in the case of Figure 2 it should be the number 6).
Figure 1. A set of examples of handwritten numbers that a machine learning algorithm (a ‘learner’) and, in this case, a neural network could be trained on.
Figure 2. A handwritten number in an 8 x 8 pixel square.
Figure 3. Graphical depiction of a neural network.
In the design of a neural network, a set of input nodes connects to a second set of nodes called the ‘hidden’ layer (like interlinked neurons in the brain) and then to an output layer (see Figure 3). Each input node is connected to a hidden layer node and each node in the hidden layer is connected to an output in the design of the neural network in Figure 3. A value or weight is associated with each of these connecting lines. The optimal values for the matrix of weights are what the learning algorithm learns. What is ‘optimal’ is defined by the set of weights that produce the most accurate possible classification of inputs (the individual pixels and their intensity ranging from white to black in an 8 × 8 matrix) to outputs (the handwritten numbers these pixels represent).
Because this is an image recognition task, we can actually visualize the optimized weights coming into the hidden layer node. In this way we can see the way a neural network breaks down the problem of recognizing a handwritten number (see Figure 4).
Figure 4. (a) The hidden layer: the black areas in each box are the areas (strokes or other patterns) that a particular hidden layer node cues in on in a handwritten digit. (b) This shows the result of the same learning algorithm being run a second time with the same training data. The reason (a) and (b) are not identical is because of the random initialization step that defines the set of weights initially to very small random numbers.
Figure 4(a) illustrates the hidden layer in a neural network. If you look at one of the 25 boxes you can see which part of a handwritten number it cues in on. Each box represents a single node in the hidden layer and each pixel within the box illustrates the value of the weight coming from one input layer node into that particular hidden layer node. In sum, each box shows the set of weights for a simplified neural network with only one hidden layer. The regions in the box that are black are the specific pixels the node in question is most sensitive to. The top left box, for example, shows a hidden layer node that cues in on darkened pixels sort of in the lower left part of the quadrant and a little bit in the middle. A combination of the calculations coming out of these hidden layer nodes yields a classification of the inputs to a number from 0 to 9.
What is notable is that the neural network doesn’t, for example, break down handwritten digit recognition into subtasks that are readily intelligible to humans, such as identifying a horizontal bar, a closed oval shape, a diagonal line, etc. This outcome, the apparent non-pattern in these weights, arises from the very notion of computational ‘learning.’ Machine learning is applied to the sorts of problems for which encoding an explicit logic of decision-making functions very poorly. In his machine learning Coursera course, Andrew Ng describes this as the domain of ‘[applications] we cannot program “by hand”.’9 The ‘hand’ is implied to be a human one.10 As noted, the craft of code writing (by humans) is two-sided communication, for fellow human programmers on the one hand and for the computer processor on the other. Where an algorithm does the ‘programming’ (i.e. optimally calculates its weights) then it logically follows that being intelligible to humans (part of the art of writing code) is no longer a concern, at least, not to the non-human ‘programmer.’
The primary purpose of this first example is to give a quick, visual sense of how the machine ‘thinks.’ Figure 4(a) should appear unintuitive, random, and disorganized. However, handwriting recognition specifically is not a ‘conscious’ reasoning task in humans either. Humans recognize visual elements in an immediate and subconscious way (thus there is certainly a kind of opacity in the human process of character recognition as well). Such an example may not seem to provide much insight into broader real-world questions about discrimination in classification. However, a recent case where automated classification in Google Photos labeled a set of photos of African-American people as ‘Gorillas’ suggests otherwise.11 To further the argument, my next example, spam filtering, looks at the automation of a task that calls upon a more conscious form of human reasoning. As a matter relating to core communication capabilities of the Internet, I show how spam filtering is of relevance to questions of classificatory discrimination.
The opacity of spam filtering
Spam has no fixed and indisputable definition (Brunton, 2013). It is generally understood to be unwelcome emails, especially those sent in bulk, but this is, in part, a designation by network administrators concerned particularly with overtaxing network resources. Spam filtering is, for this reason among others, a better application domain for thinking about machine learning based classification as socially consequential. Messages that are categorized as spam are messages that do not get through to their intended recipients. Consequently, this example relates more directly to ongoing conversations about the politics of search, ranking, and filtering content. Where a legitimate message is categorized as spam (a ‘false positive’), this is a message that has, in effect, been unwittingly censored. One question is whether the design of spam filters could make certain individuals more susceptible to having their legitimate messages diverted to spam folders. For example, does being located in a hotbed of Internet fraud or spam activity, say West Africa (Nigeria or Ghana) or Eastern Europe, create a tendency for one’s messages to be mislabeled as spam?
In Ng’s Coursera course, support vector machines (SVMs) are the machine learning model used to implement spam filtering. SVMs are another type of machine learning model like neural networks and either model could be used for spam filtering. The simplified version used in the Coursera course does not use the ‘kernel trick,’ a computational technique characteristic of SVMs, so it is essentially a form of linear regression; in technical terms it uses a ‘linear kernel.’ As an additional simplification, the programming exercise relies solely on the contents of the email to train a spam classifier, that is, the words contained in the message alone, and no email header information. These words are analyzed by the ‘learner’ algorithm to determine a set of weights. These weights measure the degree to which a given word is associated with ‘spam’ vs. ‘ham’ (non-spam) emails. Such an approach is described as a ‘bag of words.’ There is no posited semiotic relationship between the words and no meaning in the messages is extracted, nor is there an attempt in the algorithm at narrative analysis.
I offer a lightweight ‘audit’ of the algorithm and an examination of the weights produced for each word and how we might make sense of them. In particular, I focus on a type of spam email, the Nigerian 419 scam, a genre with which I have deep familiarity (Burrell, 2012). The 419 scam raises an interesting concern as far as network access and spam ‘false positives.’ In particular, are place names, particularly ‘Nigeria,’ a trigger leading to a greater likelihood of categorizing as spam?
In fact after running the training algorithm on an (admittedly) very dated public corpus12 a list of place names can be produced with their associated ‘weights.’ These weights are in a range from −1 (highly associated with non-spam emails) to 1 (highly associated with spam emails). Reassuringly perhaps for the general population of Nigerian email users, the weight associated with the word ‘Nigeria’ contained within an email is −0.001861. This means the word ‘Nigeria’ is essentially a neutral term.13 Looking at the totality of spam, this makes a certain amount of sense. On the balance of it, the vast majority of spam does not originate in nor make mention of Nigeria. Presumably, the number of totally legitimate emails that mention Nigeria would further dilute an association between the country and spam email.
The words that are in fact most associated with spam (note, these have been destemmed so that groups of words such as guarantee, guarantees, and guaranteed can be handled as equivalent terms) are the following:
    our (0.500810)
    click (0.464474)
    remov (0.417698)
    guarante (0.384834)
    visit (0.369730)
    basenumb14 (0.345389)
    dollar (0.323674)
    price (0.268065)
    will (0.264766)
    most (0.261475)
    pleas (0.259571)
In many cases these are terms we would expect to cut across genres of spam. They seem to suggest generic appeals, pleading and promises (‘guarantee’), the authority of a collective (‘our’), and concrete and quantified gain or benefit (especially monetary).
Consider below a specific example of spam in the Nigerian 419 style recently caught in the author’s gmail account spam filter, which is indeed categorized as spam by the simplified SVM spam filter (for the full email see Appendix 1):
    My Dearest,
    Greetings to you my Dear Beloved, I am Mrs Alice Walton, a citizen of United State. I bring to you a proposal worth $ 1,000,000,000.00 which I intend to use for CHARITY but I am so scared because it is hard to find a trust worthy human on earth …
In reading this email, I notice the formality of language and words like ‘dearest’ and ‘beloved.’ The mention of being a ‘citizen,’ offering ‘charity’ and looking for someone ‘trust worthy’ as well as a reference to ‘fraud’ also strike a note of suspicion. None of these words, however, are cued in on by the SVM spam filter. Rather it is the mention of money, the words ‘please,’ and ‘contact’ that are the most heavily weighted terms found in this particular email. In fact after removing the mention of money and the word ‘please’ from the email and running it through the ‘classifier’ algorithm again, it is no longer classified as spam.
Now for comparison, consider this email from a friend and research collaborator of the author, an email that has many of the same markers of the scam email genre (formality, religiosity, expressions of gratitude, etc.) but is not a scam email:
    Dear prof. Thank you for continually restoring hope and bringing live back to me when all hopes seem to be lost. With tears and profound gratitude I say thank you. … Am able to get a big generator, air-conditioned, a used professional Panasonic 3ccd video camera and still have about 150 dollars in my account for taking care of my health. … I pray you continually prosper. Much regards and Bye.
The spam classifier accurately categorizes this email as not spam, again based purely on the words it contains (with no knowledge about the author's pre-existing relationship with the sender). Nonetheless, when run through the classifier algorithm there are certain trigger words present in the email (including ‘want’ and ‘will’) and, most incriminatingly, there is mention of money. The ranking of words by ‘weight’ seems to offer a kind of lever for sense-making for the interpreting human mind, but the overall classification, even in this highly simplified example, cannot easily be ascertained by a brief skimming of the words and their associated weights in a particular email. It is the aggregate of all of the weights of the words found in the email matched to a dictionary of 1899 of the most frequently used words. Minute differences and key words (i.e. ‘visit’ or ‘will’) that cannot easily be made sense of as part of spam strategies of social engineering and persuasion may tip the balance of the classification.
Humans likely recognize and evaluate spam according to genre: the phishing scam, the Nigerian 419 email, the Viagra sales pitch. By contrast, the ‘bag of words’ approach breaks down texts into atomistic collections of units, words whose ordering is irrelevant. The algorithm surfaces very general terms characteristic of spam emails, often terms that are (in isolation) quite mundane and banal. My semantic analysis attempted to reconcile the statistical patterns the algorithm surfaces with a meaning that relates to the implicit strategy of the text as a whole, but this is decidedly not how the machine ‘thinks.’
Reconsidering ‘interpretability’
The example provided of classifying Nigerian 419 style spam emails gives some insights into the strengths and shortcomings of a code audit. Finding ways to reveal something of the internal logic of an algorithm can address concerns about lack of ‘fairness’ and discriminatory effects, sometimes with reassuring evidence of the algorithm's objectivity, as in the case of the neutral weighting of the word ‘Nigeria.’ On the other hand, probing further into the ‘why’ of a particular classification decision yielded suggestive evidence that seemed sufficient as an explanation, but this imposed a process of human interpretive reasoning on a mathematical process of statistical optimization. In other words, machine thinking was resolved to human interpretation. Yet ambiguities remained, such as the weighting of innocuous words like ‘visit’ and ‘want’ as indicators for spam. This raises doubts about whether an explanation produced in this way to satisfy the ‘why’ question was necessarily a particularly correct one.
Computer scientists term this opacity issue a problem of ‘interpretability.’ One approach to building more interpretable classifiers is to implement an end-user facing component to provide not only the classification outcome, but also exposing some of the logic of this classification. A real-world implementation of this in the domain of spam filtering is found in Google’s gmail ‘spam’ folder. If you select a spam message in this folder, a yellow alert box with the query ‘why is this message in Spam?’ above the text of the email itself provides one reason why it has been placed in this folder.15 Messages include ‘it contains content that’s typically used in spam messages’ (perhaps a reference to a ‘bag of words’ type of approach) and ‘many people marked similar messages as phishing scams, so this might contain unsafe content.’ And yet, explanations that bring forward a human-manageable list of key criteria (i.e. the 10 most heavily weighted/spammy words present in an email or a single sentence description) provide an understanding that is at best incomplete16 and at worst false reassurance.
Further complicating the attempts to draw a direct line between ‘weighted’ inputs and classification outcomes is the mathematical manipulation that happens in between. Unlike the examples of handwriting recognition and spam filtering presented here, it is often the case that the relationship between a feature and a dimension in the model is not one-to-one. Ways of manipulating dimensionality (through principal component analysis or the ‘kernel trick’ in SVMs, to give two examples) are often employed to manage computational constraints or to improve accuracy.
The continuing expansion of computational power has produced certain optimization strategies that exaggerate this particular problem of opacity as the complexity of scale even further. With greater computational resources, and many terabytes of data to mine (now often collected opportunistically from the digital traces of users’ activities), the number of possible features to include in a classifier rapidly grows way beyond what can be easily grasped by a reasoning human. In an article on the folk knowledge of applying machine learning,Domingos (2012) notes that ‘intuition fails at high-dimensions.’ In other words, reasoning about, debugging, or improving the algorithm becomes more difficult with more qualities or characteristics provided as inputs, each subtly and imperceptibly shifting the resulting classification.
For handling this fundamental opacity there are various proposed approaches. One approach, perhaps surprisingly, is to avoid using machine learning algorithms in certain critical domains of application.17 There are also ways of simplifying machine learning models such as ‘feature extraction’, an approach that analyses what features actually matter to the classification outcome, removing all other features from the model. Some solutions perhaps wisely abandon answering the ‘why’ question and devise metrics that can, in other ways, evaluate discrimination (i.e. Datta et al., 2015). For example, in ‘Fairness Through Awareness’ a discriminatory effect in classification algorithms can be detected without extracting the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of particular classification decisions (Dwork et al., 2011). In some ways this extends the approach of the external audit proposed by Sandvig et al. (2014) and by Diakopoulos (2013) using sophisticated algorithmic implementations.
Conclusion
    There may be something in the end impenetrable about algorithms. (Gillespie, 2012)
The goal of this article was to look more deeply into machine learning algorithms and the nature of their ‘opacity’, relating this to sociological interests in classification and discrimination. This is part of an ongoing reorientation of the scholarship on ‘digital inequality’ which has frequently focused on the distribution of computational resources and skills (Hargittai, 2008) but not, until recently, the question of how people may be subject to computational classification, privacy invasions, or other surveillance in ways that are unequal across the general population and could be in violation of existing regulatory protections (Barocas and Selbst, 2016; Eubanks, 2012; Fourcade and Healy, 2013).
Legal critiques of algorithmic opacity often focus on the capacity for intentional secrecy and lead to calls for regulations to enforce transparency. Pasquale (2015) argues for the use of auditors who have access to the code and can assure that classifications are non-discriminatory. Another approach is to educate a broader swathe of society in code writing and computational skills to lessen the problem of a homogenous and elite class of technical people making consequential decisions that cannot be easily assessed by non-members. However, the opacity of machine learning algorithms is challenging at a more fundamental level. When a computer learns and consequently builds its own representation of a classification decision, it does so without regard for human comprehension. Machine optimizations based on training data do not naturally accord with human semantic explanations. The examples of handwriting recognition and spam filtering helped to illustrate how the workings of machine learning algorithms can escape full understanding and interpretation by humans, even for those with specialized training, even for computer scientists.
Ultimately partnerships between legal scholars, social scientists, domain experts, along with computer scientists may chip away at these challenging questions of fairness in classification in light of the barrier of opacity. Additionally, user populations and the general public can give voice to exclusions and forms of experienced discrimination (algorithmic or otherwise) that the ‘domain experts’ may lack insight into.18 Alleviating problems of black boxed classification will not be accomplished by a single tool or process, but some combination of regulations or audits (of the code itself and, more importantly, of the algorithms functioning), the use of alternatives that are more transparent (i.e. open source), education of the general public as well as the sensitization of those bestowed with the power to write such consequential code. The particular combination of approaches will depend upon what a given application space requires.

Most scholars in this space focus on particular application spaces without specifying the technical categories of algorithms that are used. Gillespie looks at search, trending, and other content filtering and ranking algorithms (2012), Pasquale looks at reputation, search, and finance algorithms (2015), Brunton considers spam filtering (2013) while Diakopoulos's (2013) consideration is wide-ranging but tied to data journalism. Sandvig looks at search while briefly considering basic sorting algorithms taught in introductory computer science courses (2015). Solon Barocas’s work focusing on machine learning algorithms specifically is a major exception to this trend (Barocas, 2014a; Barocas, 2014b; Barocas and Selbst, 2016).

To program ‘by hand’ (in the context of classification decisions) would also entail outlining explicitly a logic of decision-making, specifically about which category to place a piece of data into. This ‘rationalistic’ approach known as symbolic AI (Olazaran, 1996) was once dominant. It is sometimes referred to, with more than a bit of nostalgia, as Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI) (Winograd, 2006) and it entailed the symbolic representation of knowledge in a way that is strictly formalized. However, this approach failed to live up to its early promise and underperformed on many tasks, leading to an AI ‘winter’ when interest and funding waned (Grudin, 2006).

One computer scientist likewise reminds us that ‘the whole reason we turn to machine learning rather than handcrafted decision rules is that for many problems, simple, easily understood decision theory is insufficient’ Lipton (2015).

One social scientist doing field work among researchers developing a self-driving car found that these researchers avoid using machine learning entirely because ‘you don’t know what it learns.’ The innumerable situations not represented in the training set lead to unpredictable and possibly potentially life-threatening consequences (Both, 2014). In personal conversations with the author, researchers at Yahoo! and Fair Isaacs Corporation (the source for FICO scores) have also described an avoidance of machine learning algorithms for this reason. In the credit market this isn’t just a preference, but enforced through the Fair Credit Reporting Act which requires that reasons be provided to consumers for denied credit. ‘Alternative credit scoring’ or ‘consumer scoring’ agencies, however, do freely use ML models and are not (yet) subject to these regulations.

    Greetings to you my Dear Beloved, I am Mrs Alice Walton, a citizen of United State. I bring to you a proposal worth $ 1,000,000,000.00 which I intend to use for CHARITY but I am so scared because it is hard to find a trust worthy human on earth. I am happy to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be afraid. I know there are lots of fraud out there sending messages like these or in other form. I saw your email contact at the ministries of commerce and foreign trade departments.
    I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart,
    It is painful now to let you know that I have been suffering from a Heart disease for the past 22 years and just few weeks ago my Doctor told me that I won't survive the illness for long.
    I am contacting you as I was touched to open up to you about my project.
    Please reply me back if you are interested, but if not please ignore this message.
    God Bless You.

Non-spam email from Ghanaian researcher and friend:
    Dear prof. Thank you for continually restoring hope and bringing live back to me when all hopes seem to be lost. With tears and profound gratitude I say thank you. I have delayed in responding because I didn't want to tell you am still not better. Am responding to treatment even though am not that well. Am able to get a big generator, air-conditioned, a used professional Panasonic 3ccd video camera and still have about 150 dollars in my account for taking care of my health. Also I have changed my phone from a problematic old Nokia to an h 6 tecno [advanced China phone]. The doctors say I have malaria parasites. Only God knows when I will be very okay. I can't imagine how life would have been without you. I pray you continually prosper. Much regards and Bye.

Publication loaded248Media, Culture & Society 39(2)(previous) user behavior, others’ (previous) user behavior, information on user-connected-ness, and location.Algorithmic  selection  differs  from  traditional  mass-media  selection  mechanisms,  which operate with a time delay and are mostly targeted at well-defined general publics and (mass) markets whose characteristics are known from limited data sources (repre-sentative  polls,  socio-demographic  patterns,  TV  meters  in  selected  households)  com-pared to big data in the case of algorithmic reality mining and construction. The database for algorithmic selection applications consists of both active consumer input (e.g. feed-back) and passive data (e.g. location-based, clickstream, social contacts).A major difference is the special role of users in algorithmic reality-construction pro-cesses. They are no longer simply the addressees of media messages, with limited or no interaction between sender and receiver, but – together with algorithms – they assume an important role as secondary gatekeepers (Singer, 2014; Wallace, 2015), data providers, and inputs into selection processes, which are increasingly based on previous and pre-dicted  behavioral  patterns  generated  from  real-time  data.  Consequently,  personalized  results  of  algorithmic  selection  procedures  sum  up  to  different  individual  realities.  Altogether, this amplifies existing audience fragmentation and individualization trends, resulting from the proliferation of media outlets triggered by liberalization, privatization, and digitalization. In general, both the fragmentation and individualization of audiences have been discussed as being detrimental to democracy (Katz, 1996; Mancini, 2013), and personalized reality constructions by algorithmic selection exacerbate these concerns.Dangerous and endangered individuals.According to Schroer (2008), the debate on indi-vidualization distinguishes between various lines of reasoning and emphasizes the dan-gerous and the endangered individual or combinations of both. While the debate on the dangerous individual focuses on the threat to social cohesion and order due to increased individualization and the subsequent erosion of common norms and institutions, the dis-cussion  about  the  endangered  individual  highlights  the  controlled  individual.  More  effective control and disciplining take the place of increasing autonomy and freedom of action that individualization actually promises. The individual is consequently not liber-ated but more strictly controlled. Algorithmic reality construction as a result of a continu-ing  evolutionary  differentiation  of  information  and  media  systems  further  enables  and  fosters  individualization  in  the  form  of  dangerous  individuals.  Individual  autonomy,  alternatives, and scope are further expanding, resulting in a further liberation from com-mon societal bonds. At the same time, however, new forms of connectivity (Van Dijck, 2013),  new  bonds,  and  (weak)  ties  (Kavanaugh  et  al.,  2005)  are  created.  In  addition,  algorithmic  selection  also  results  in  endangered  individuals  due  to  increased  control,  stemming, among other things, from highly customized personalization efforts. The dis-cussions on data protection, privacy, data ownership, access to information, and surveil-lance highlight the control aspects entailed in increasing automation, reality mining, and algorithmic selection.Deliberate individualized media use of dangerous individuals may result in the weak-ening of bonds with traditional media institutions, as seen especially in the debates on the future role of public service media in the light of changes in media usage patterns and available  media  outlets.  Moreover,  specific  forms  of  algorithmic  personalization  may  Just and Latzer 249lead to isolating, echo-chamber effects (Sunstein, 2007), also discussed as filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011). Accordingly, concerns are raised regarding the general impact of algo-rithmic selection on people’s access to information via search, social media, and aggre-gators and amplified by trends toward further customization enabled by services such as Google  Now,  Cortana  (Microsoft),  and  Proactive  Assistants  (Apple).  Altogether,  this  may  lead  to  situations  where  people  only  access  information  that  confirms  their  own  opinion or communicate with like-minded people, with potentially negative democratic consequences for societies, such as endangering two preconditions for democratic sys-tems: unplanned encounters and shared experience (Sunstein, 2007).Networked, secondary, non-journalistic filtering.The fact that algorithmic selection is assum-ing (secondary) agenda-setting and (secondary) gatekeeping roles via news aggregators, via ranking algorithms in discussion forums, and in social online networks like Facebook leads  to  the  assessment  that  algorithms  considerably  affect  the  way  public  opinion  is  formed,  that  they  govern  the  public  agenda  (Bakker,  2012;  Machill  et  al.,  2013;  Van  Dalen,  2012).  Filtering  by  algorithmic  selection  should  at  least  be  seen  combined  or  networked with the filtering by mass media (Barzilai-Nahon, 2008). It may be primary or secondary filtering (Singer, 2014); the latter refers to the situation where, for example, regarding political information, these algorithmic processes are based on the results of traditional agenda-setting and gatekeeping by the mass media, and then a second ‘filter-ing’ (algorithmic selection) takes place based on automated combinations of user behav-ior, established connections, and non-journalistic, customized filtering criteria.Special actors’ constellation in algorithmic reality constructionMajor features of the actors’ constellation in algorithmic reality construction include the dominance of private companies and interests, rising platformization, and algorithms as actors and policy-makers.The question of who determines the criteria for these socially sensitive selection pro-cesses is paramount. Traditionally, the selection of news was a manual human or institu-tionalized privilege of journalists and their (national) media organizations on the basis, among  other  things,  of  news  factors.  The  selection  was  targeted  at  a  (geographically)  distinct  mass  audience  and  at  least  considered  to  be  in  accord  with  high  standards  of  social responsibility, especially in the case of public service media. Now, in the case of algorithmic reality construction, the selection happens automatically through customized software and services mostly developed and dominated by global IT companies.Dominance of private governance by global companies.A distinction can be made between private and public algorithmic governance. Empirical research shows that global IT com-panies dominate in markets where algorithmic selection is applied either as core or as ancillary service (Table 2). This is an indicator of the wide societal spread and impact of these technologies in general and of their essential governing influence on the evolution of the Internet in particular.Public algorithmic selection services also exist but are employed less often, for exam-ple, for public security objectives (e.g. predictive policing, public surveillance). Private 250Media, Culture & Society 39(2)algorithmic  selection  services,  for  example,  Google  Flu,  which  predicts  disease  out-breaks (Lazer et al., 2014), could be used for public governance purposes as well. This in turn raises additional (black box) challenges, if findings cannot be replicated and are based on proprietary private data sets of unknown quality. With the notion of ‘Blackbox Table 2.Algorithmic selection in top 10 websites worldwide.RankingWebsiteCompany and country of originAlgorithmic selection as core serviceAlgorithmic selection as ancillary service1google.comGoogle (USA)General search engineComputational advertisingAutocomplete2facebook.comFacebook (USA)Computational advertisingFiltering (EdgeRank)Social search (GraphSearch)Recommendations (contacts)3youtube.comGoogle (USA)Computational advertisingVariety of recommendationsSpecial search engine4baidu.comBaidu (CHN)General search engineComputational advertisingAutocomplete5yahoo.comYahoo (USA)General search engineComputational advertisingAutocomplete6amazon.comAmazon (USA)Special search (products)Recommendations (products)Reputation (marketplace sellers)7wikipedia.orgWikimedia Foundation (USA)Special search engine8qq.comTencent (CHN)General search engineComputational advertisingAutocomplete9taobao.comAlibaba Group (CHN)Special search (products) Recommendations (products) Reputation (marketplace sellers)10twitter.comTwitter (USA)Computational advertisingAggregations/recommendations (Twitter Trends, Who to Follow)Source: Ranking based on alexa.com, 9 July 2015.Core function basically means that the result of algorithmic selection is the product demanded (e.g. search results), and ancillary functions are used to support the core service of a company in order to gain competi-tive advantage (e.g. algorithmic recommendations in e-commerce services).252Media, Culture & Society 39(2)Algorithms  as  autonomous  actors  and  policy-makers.Compared  to  realities  traditionally  constructed  by  the  mass  media,  a  further  difference  in  the  constellation  of  actors  for  automated algorithmic reality construction is the potential role of technology as an actor (Braman, 2002; Napoli, 2014). Do algorithms only solve problems on behalf of humans? Are algorithms non-human actors that are inherently connected with human actors? Or are algorithms independent, autonomous actors themselves?In  particular,  the  question  of  the  power  of  algorithms,  indicated  by  the  degree  of  autonomy  in  their  decision-making,  needs  to  be  discussed,  their  use  as  instruments  to  exert  power  but  also  as  themselves  having  power  to  enforce  objectives  against  others’  interests.  This  includes  issues  of  algorithms’  agency,  responsibility,  and  predictability,  whether they are only problem-solving, computerized human instructions, if their activi-ties and output are and always remain foreseeable. Predictability may be compromised, for example, with advances in machine intelligence and leads to a situation where man-ual  computer  programming  becomes  inferior  to  computers’  self-learning  processes  regarding the optimal exploitation of existing (big) data.Applications based on algorithmic selection (see Table 1) are characterized by the co-evolution of humans (developers, user) and non-humans (algorithms) within a networked information  society  (see  Figure  2).  Humans  shape  algorithms  and  are  simultaneously  shaped by them. According to ANT – Actor–Network Theory – (Latour, 2005) humans and  algorithms  are  equal  actants  within  this  network.  Mitcham  (2014)  shows  how  the  contested  assessment  of  agency  and  intentions  of  artifacts  has  changed  over  time.  His  overview helps to tackle the question of whether and how (moral) human agency is trans-ferred to algorithms. Accordingly, human agency is either imposed or delegated to algo-rithms. The first results in a secondary/imposed agency of intentionless algorithms used to extend human (political) agency (Winner, 1986). Examples would be comparably sim-ple and controllable algorithmic selections based on small data sets. This form of imposed agency of technology is also found in reality construction via traditional mass media. In the second case, algorithms act with delegated agency in a trustee-mode within a range of  possible  actions,  comparable  to  public  broadcasters  or  human  delegates/representa-tives like parliamentarians. This delegated agency appropriately reflects the majority of current  and  anticipated  algorithmic  reality  constructions.  Technological  progress  in  machine  learning  –  including  data  mining,  computational  statistics  and  neuronal  net-works, increasing availability of big data sets in combination with the potential to dis-cover unexpected similarities between old and new data that make it possible to solve non-routine tasks, and a growing automation and division of labor in software engineer-ing (Frey and Osborne, 2013) – supports this assessment. Accordingly, algorithms can be considered as agent-like artifacts or actors and – depending on their use – even as policy-makers. They are autonomous within a predefined – but barely controllable – scope of action.  There  is  distributed  agency  (Rammert,  2008)  between  humans  and  algorithms  and also between algorithms, characterized by an increasingly complex and contingent interactivity. Alongside relative autonomy, these algorithmic agents are characterized by reactivity, pro-activeness, and sociability (Rammert, 2003).Altogether, reality construction, both via the mass media and algorithmic selection, is a co-production of humans and technology. However, for algorithmic reality construction, agency is not only imposed, as in traditional mass-media technology, but predominantly Just and Latzer 253delegated, allowing limited algorithmic intentions and autonomy. Overall, the (delegated) power  of  algorithms  is  rising.  A  high  degree  of  complexity  in  the  cooperation  between  algorithmic agents and humans results in low transparency (not only for users, as in the mass media, but also for producers), controllability, and predictability compared to reality construction  by  traditional  mass  media.  Agency  and  accountability  problems  become  more  important  (Chopra  and  White,  2011)  as  well  as  the  moral  significance  (Verbeek,  2014) of algorithms. Even programmers and software engineers increasingly do not know what ‘their’ algorithmic selection produces (Auerbach, 2015). Hence, the discussed dis-closure of source codes might often not be a sufficient solution for more democratic con-trol, and there are hardly any other public measures to control the morality in algorithmic reality construction.Technology as problem and solutionAlgorithmic  governance  not  only  contributes  to  economic  welfare  gains  that  increase  subjective well-being (e.g. by boosting economic circulation and by reducing complex-ity) but also produces considerable social risks that compromise potential welfare gains. Against  the  background  of  far-reaching  algorithmic  governance  effects,  this  raises  the  question  of  whether  public-policy  measures  are  needed  (e.g.  public-interest  search  engines).  These  questions  are  discussed  under  the  term  governance  of  algorithms  (Saurwein et al., 2015) and based on identified risks, including manipulation, bias, het-eronomy,  threats  to  privacy,  intellectual  property  rights,  and  freedom  of  expression  (Latzer et al., 2014). Taken together, three categories of risk are discernible: the impacts on the mediation of reality, the threats to basic rights and liberties, and the challenges to the future development of the human species.Governance by technology, more precisely by its architecture and design, is consid-ered  to  be  the  problem  for  all  of  the  above  risks,  but  it  is  also  technology  that  offers  solutions.  Governance  by  design  is  taking  place  more  or  less  intentionally.  It  is  pre-dominantly applied for special interests, but could be also used to further public policies and  public  goals.  The  example  of  a  decentralized  architectural  design  for  P2P  video  streaming (Musiani, 2013) shows how governance by design could be used to further public goals, for example, the protection of privacy. For algorithmic design, it can be demonstrated how design both creates and could eliminate filter bubbles (e.g. by special widgets)  that  affect  the  democratically  sensitive  issue  of  public-opinion  formation  (Munson et al., 2013).Summary and conclusionThis article explores the governance by algorithms on the Internet. It focuses on Internet-based services that build on algorithmic selection, that is, the automated assignment of relevance to selected pieces of information. In order to grasp this fast-growing phenom-enon  and  its  societal  relevance,  the  article  provides  an  empirically  based  functional  typology of the rapidly growing number of services that build on automated algorithmic selection on the Internet (Table 1). This typology demonstrates the broad scope of algo-rithmic  selection  applications  in  information  societies,  with  algorithmized  societal  254Media, Culture & Society 39(2)functions ranging from search and recommendations to forecasts and content production. The functioning of these services can be understood by applying and specifying a basic input–throughput–output model (Figure 1).Algorithmic selection applications are a prime example of the growing importance of software – not only for the media sector as part of quaternary media but also far beyond. Moreover,  it  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  governing  role  of  software.  As  an  institution,  software  affects  societies  similarly  to  laws,  contracts,  and  values  that  are  imprinted  in  algorithms. A basic governance model of technological and societal change (Figure 2) shows the co-evolutionary interplay and highlights the role of technology as simultane-ously designing and being designed. Algorithms are active as governance tools and also as self-learning and relatively autonomous actors in increasingly complex ecosystems, characterized by non-linear developments, emergence, and feedback loops. The conse-quences of growing complexity are declining predictability and controllability, as well as increasingly  unintended  consequences  of  private  and  public  attempts  to  govern  via  algorithms.Based on empirical-analytical findings, it is argued that algorithmic selection on the Internet  has  become  a  growing  source  of  and  factor  in  social  order,  in  a  shared  social  reality in societies, which is increasingly being co-constructed by automated algorithmic selection  on  the  Internet.  Automated  algorithmic  selection  applications  shape  realities  and daily lives, increasingly affect the perception of the world, and influence behavior. They influence not only what we think about but also how we think about it and conse-quently how we act, thereby co-shaping the construction of individuals’ realities, struc-turally similar but essentially different to mass media.Algorithmic reality construction has various peculiarities and differs from reality con-struction by the traditional mass media, recoining realities, and consequently the social order in contemporary information societies. In general, these differences lie first in the growing  personalization  of  constructed  realities  and  the  subsequent  individualization  effects. Second, there are major differences in the constellation of actors, a constituent part of the Internet’s ecosystem.Personalization as a formative feature of algorithmic reality construction happens in essence on the basis of user characteristics, behavior, and location. It furthers individu-alization in societies, both in the form of dangerous and endangered individuals: danger-ous in the sense of fragmentation, fewer unplanned encounters and less shared experience, and decreasing social cohesion; endangered in the sense of more controlled individuals, with less privacy and freedom. Nonetheless, technology not only causes these problems but at the same time offers solutions by the way it is designed.The special constellation of actors in algorithmic reality construction is, in essence, marked by the dominance of private governance by global companies, increasing plat-formization, and algorithms as actors and policy-makers. The prevalence of private algo-rithmic governance based on proprietary big data tends to strengthen selection criteria oriented on special interests concerned with profit maximization, thus weakening public-interest goals and social responsibility in the construction of reality and eventually con-solidating  and  creating  new  social  inequalities.  Algorithms  as  intermediaries  push  the  platformization of markets and modify power structures, leading the mass media to lose ground  in  the  construction  of  realities.  Moreover,  the  increasing  role  of  algorithms  as  258Media, Culture & Society 39(2)Sunstein CR (2007) Republic.com 2.0.

(Shklovskij 1998; Gunn 1984), was a significant recurring theme among the artists we interviewed. Like
guerilla interactive artists such as the Yes Men (Perini 2010), McCarthy’s work seeks to closely capture the
texture of digitally mediated life in ways that are both “replicatory and reiterative” of consumer
technologies, while introducing moments of strangeness and alienation to prompt stronger audience
reflection (Raley 2009: 12).
Many artists sought to provoke audiences by defamiliarizing the opaque and proprietary nature of software
tools commonly covered by trade secret protections and functioning as “black boxes” (Pasquale 2015). “The
market is pushing technology toward convenience,” observed Paris-based artist Evan Roth, “and any time
technology goes to convenience we lose freedoms within that technology” [interview]. Echoing
longstanding work in science and technology studies (Latour 1983), artists like Roth noted that the design
of digital technologies is increasingly remote and illegible to users. Roth’s ongoing series of paintings, titled
Multi-Touch, seeks to disrupt everyday interactions with networked devices like smart phones by translating
the gestural language of swiping across a screen into abstract painting (Roth 2012; Stinson 2014), attempting
to defamiliarize the quotidian practices of interaction between humans and machines.
Other artists described deploying defamiliarization to mobilize audience emotions as an explicitly ethical
act. “Art has this ability to give someone an experience of something,” observed Heather Dewey-Hagborg,
a mixed-media artist and faculty member at the Art Institute of Chicago [interview]. Dewey-Hagborg is
widely known for her 2013 project Stranger Visions—which created human masks from DNA obtained
from found objects such as chewing gum and cigarette butts (Dewey-Hagborg 2013)—and her 2017 piece
Probably Chelsea, presenting thirty different portraits based on the DNA of whistleblower and trans activist
Chelsea Manning (Dewey-Hagborg 2017). The aim of both works was to make quotidian devices, data
practices, and identities seem unfamiliar and uncanny.
Likewise, digital media artist Julian Oliver sought to engender “a productive paranoia... a healthy anxiety
if you like” [interview]. Oliver and Danja Vasiliev created the 2014 Berlin Transmediale festival project
Prism: The Beacon Frame (Oliver 2014) to send text messages purporting to be from the NSA to visitors’
phones. By scrambling the familiar bounds of individual and collective consent, Oliver and other artists
sought to draw attention, both intellectually and viscerally (Stark 2016), to the realities of how we perceive
the privacy and connectivity of digital devices. Likewise, British artist and author James Bridle’s projects
seek to foreground and make explicit the ways networked data systems interact with the material world: his
2014 The Right to Flight involved launching a weather balloon over London equipped with free anonymous
Wi-Fi routers and accessible mesh networks to highlight the dangers of the internet’s corporate control
(Bridle 2014a), while his 2017 piece Autonomous Trap 001 uses a simple chalk circle to confuse the visual
sensors of a self-driving car (Mufson 2017).
The artists we interviewed sometimes deployed techniques of defamiliarization to make unfamiliar elements
of computational technology seem normalized and domestic, as with Crowdpilot; in other cases, such as
Oliver’s Prism, artists presented everyday abstracted objects and practices as alien or discomforting.
Sometimes the work focused on showing where systems fail, or how they can be turned against themselves,
like Bridle’s trapped autonomous car. Tactics of defamiliarization were matched with the desire to produce
a strong emotional response. Many of the artists we interviewed claimed they wanted audiences to confront
their relationship to technology when presented with their artwork: forcing a kind of friction and reflection
was central to the ethical impact these artists sought rather than producing the “right” emotional effect.
These artists sought to make audiences reflect on how artificial intelligence and data systems are
embodied—not abstract—elements of everyday existence.
The Ethics of Defamiliarization
Some artists we interviewed admitted to being seduced by the technical capacities of large-scale data
acquisition and analysis. “I was interested in how much people put out there on dating sites and I was
interested in how appallingly easy it is to derive a serious lock on those people,” composer, academic, and

Surveillance & Society 17(3/4) 450
Poitras, “which isn’t to say we shouldn’t engage and ask questions about ethics and morals” (Poitras and
Crawford 2015). Artists cited recent cases in which work involving emerging technologies had come into
conflict with the authorities, such as the arrest of bio-artist Steven Kurtz on terrorism charges, later
dismissed, in 2004 (Duke 2004).
For these artists, ethics practices developed socially in the context of shared conversations about aesthetics.
Conversations about the ethics of particular data art practices took place in the context of social ties, pre-
existing friendships, or working relationships. Artists articulated a delicate balancing act: engaging with the
social implications of a particular work while still respecting the creative autonomy of individual artists.
Crucially, artists explained their responsibility to be courageous in discussing the ethics of a particular work
through making aesthetic or formal critiques of a piece. The ability to navigate the ethical challenges of
aesthetic practice was thus seen by many of our interlocutors as a criterion for individual artistic quality.
Data Artists and the Ethics of Ambiguity
The formal connection between ethics and aesthetics is supported by a position in the philosophy of
aesthetics known as moderate moralism (Carroll 2000): when information itself is a palette, it highlights the
interconnections between the materials of practice, the producers of those materials, the ethical implications
of an artwork’s effects. Artists pointed to a loose set of pragmatic norms around which interventions might
be ethical and which might not be. Disagreement around the ethics of particular works often stemmed from
artists’ differing conceptions of the work’s aesthetic impact in a particular context. The artists we
interviewed outlined a number of possible strategies to articulate their own practice around making these
assessments. “I try to separate ‘ethics’ from ‘morality,’” Cirio suggested. “My projects are not totally moral
in a way because of the provocations push the limits of social norms...but I always try to be ethical, so for
example, they [subjects] can ask to be removed from this database” [interview].
Many artists noted the ways in which ethical concerns were incorporated into the substance of aesthetic or
formal critiques, particularly when the artist concerned with a work did not know its maker personally. “I
see a responsibility to not hurt anyone as much as I can . . . obviously not intentionally but also to take
measures to try and not hurt anyone unintentionally,” noted McCarthy [interview]. Artists observed public
engagement around data ethics was also in its infancy, and artists could actively provide valuable insights
to the broader conversation if they chose. Yet what types of interventions were valuable was still open for
significant debate.
To complement Benjamin’s observations on the political stakes of art, we suggest further recourse to a
powerful parallel strain of thought from post-war existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir: what she
terms “the ethics of ambiguity.” In Beauvoir’s ([1949] 2011: 138) words, an ambiguous ethics suggests all
people “must decide upon the opportuneness of an act and attempt to measure its effectiveness without
knowing all the factors that are present.” The effects of artistic provocations may be unknowable, but for
Beauvoir, it is the ethical duty of the artist to both make the attempt and to be reflective of their own role
and agency as ethical actors (Raley 2009).
Artists expressed awareness of the ways in which ambiguity was expressed through their engagement with
the material world, the built environment, and the complex routines of how individuals use digital
technology. They frequently sought to leverage this ambiguity to produce destabilizations,
defamiliarizations, shock, and active reflection in their audiences. Some artists placed themselves at the
embodied center of these defamiliarizations: a work like artist and researcher Mimi Onuoha’s Pulse
(Onuoha 2016), a site-specific 2016 performance in which Onuoha connected herself to a heart monitor and
broadcast a visualization of her heartbeat in real time, is one example of how the specific temporal and
spatial ethical position of the individual might complicate or subvert the classifying and quantifying metrics
of digital data. “It’s an uncertainty that focuses attention and brings up complicated questions,” noted Bridle
[interview]. “A choice,” Beauvoir ([1949] 2011: 138) noted regarding the moral responsibility invested in
aesthetic choice, “is no more arbitrary than a hypothesis; it excludes neither reflection nor even method; but

28 Online Harms White Paper
digital markets, due in summer 2019. This will be informed by the work of the independent
Digital Competition Expert Panel, led by Professor Jason Furman which published its
recommendations for government on 13 March 2019.
1.34 Professor Furman and the panel found that the digital economy has brought significant
benefits but does not have enough competition. They called for a new digital markets unit to
set and enforce a code of conduct so the largest digital companies know what are acceptable
rules for competition. This new unit would give people more control over their data by
enabling people to switch between platforms more easily. They also recommended changes
to merger rules, and updating existing rules to improve enforcement over anticompetitive
conduct. The government will consider these proposals and respond later in the year.
1.35 Thriving digital markets also rely on the innovative, efficient and fair use of data. In June
2018, the Secretary of State for DCMS announced that we would develop a National Data
Strategy to ensure the UK is a world-leading data economy – unlocking the power of data
across government and the wider economy, while building public trust and confidence in
its use.
Online advertising
1.36 Online advertising plays a crucial role in the digital economy, with many free digital
services, such as search engines or social networks, funded by advertising revenues. The
online advertising ecosystem is highly complex, with much of the advertising space online
bought through automated processes, and the velocity with which adverts are created and
displayed is far higher than offline. Online advertising encourages and rewards the collection
of user data (the more data a service has on a user the more effectively it can target adverts
at them) and the holding of people’s attention (the longer they use a service the more adverts
they see).
1.37 This combination of factors has given rise to a number of issues caused by or related to
online advertising. Work is already underway to address some of these:
• A Home Office-led working group on CSEA and terrorist content linked to
advertising met in March 2019, following an initial meeting in December 2018,
comprising representatives from advertising trade bodies, agencies, brands, law
enforcement and the IWF. The working group’s activity to date comprises actions
to help ensure advertising is not supporting this kind of illegal activity.
• As part of the government’s Childhood Obesity Plan, DCMS and the Department
of Health and Social Care launched a consultation on 18 March 2019 on
introducing a 9pm watershed on TV advertising of products high in fat, salt or
sugar, and similar protections for children viewing adverts online.
• The Competition and Markets Authority is considering further work on digital
advertising, although this is dependent on the outcome of EU exit negotiations.
• In November 2018 the Advertising Standards Authority published its strategy More
Impact Online, which aims to put the protection of consumers online at the heart of
its work over the next five years, and makes commitments to explore, for example,
the use of machine learning and AI to improve regulation.
• In 2018, the ICO conducted an investigation into data analytics and micro targeting
of political advertising online. The report, ‘Democracy Disrupted?’, highlighted the
risks of personal data being abused in digital campaigning and made a number
PART 2: Regulatory model 43
Companies will still need to be compliant with the overarching duty of care even where a
specific code does not exist, for example assessing and responding to the risk associated
with emerging harms or technology.
3.7 There will be a strong expectation that companies follow the guidance set out in these
codes. If they choose not to do so, companies will have to explain and justify to the regulator
how their alternative approach will effectively deliver the same or greater level of impact.
This approach is familiar to companies, for example the UK Corporate Governance Code68
and the ICO’s code of practice on data sharing. Though these codes will be developed with
the companies and other stakeholders in an open and transparent way, the regulator will
ultimately decide on their content.
3.8 The regulator will assess whether companies have fulfilled their duty of care, including
by reference to relevant codes of practice, and compliance with the company’s own relevant
terms and conditions. Failure to meet these obligations may result in enforcement action by
the regulator. Further details on enforcement are in Chapter 6.
3.9 The regulator will also expect companies to make clear how they are fulfilling their
statutory duty of care. Relevant terms and conditions will be required to be sufficiently clear
and accessible, including to children and other vulnerable users. The regulator will assess how
effectively these terms are enforced as part of any regulatory action.
Terrorism and CSEA online
3.10 Companies will be required to take particularly robust action to tackle terrorist use of
the internet and online CSEA. The government will have the power to issue directions to the
regulator regarding the content of the codes of practice for these harms, and will also approve
the draft codes before they are brought into effect. Similarly, the regulator will not normally
agree to companies adopting proposals which diverge from these two codes of practice, and
will require a high burden of proof that alternative proposals will be effective.
3.11 Between the publication of this White Paper and the establishment of a regulator, the
government will work with law enforcement and other relevant bodies to produce interim
codes of practice for online terrorist content and CSEA. These codes will be published later
this year.
General monitoring
3.12 The regulator will not compel companies to undertake general monitoring of all
communications on their online services, as this would be a disproportionate burden on
companies and would raise concerns about user privacy. The government believes that there
is however, a strong case for mandating specific monitoring that targets where there is a
threat to national security or the physical safety of children, such as CSEA and terrorism.
Transparency, trust and accountability
3.13 Developing a culture of transparency, trust and accountability, and consistent standards
of transparency, will be a critical element of the new regulatory framework.

PART 2: Regulatory model 49
4: Companies in scope of the regulatory framework
Summary
• The regulatory framework will apply to companies that provide services or tools
that allow, enable or facilitate users to share or discover user-generated content, or
interact with each other online.
• These services are offered by a wide range of companies, including start-ups and
SMEs, and other organisations such as charities.
• The application of the regulatory requirements and the duty of care model will reflect
the diversity of organisations in scope and ensure a risk-based and proportionate
approach. We will minimise excessive burdens, particularly on small businesses and
civil society organisations.
• Reflecting the importance of privacy, any requirements to scan or monitor content for
tightly defined categories of illegal content will not apply to private channels. We are
consulting on definitions of private communications, and what measures should apply
to these services.
4.1 Harmful content and behaviour originates from and migrates across a wide range of
online platforms or services, and these cannot readily be categorised by reference to a single
business model or sector. Focusing on the services provided by companies, rather than their
business model or sector, limits the risk that online harms simply move and proliferate outside
of the ambit of the new regulatory framework. We propose that the regulatory framework
should apply to companies that allow users to share or discover user-generated content, or
interact with each other online.
4.2 There are two main types of online activity that can give rise to the online harms in
scope or compound their effects:
• Hosting, sharing and discovery of user-generated content (e.g. a post on a public
forum or the sharing of a video).
• Facilitation of public and private online interaction between service users (e.g.
instant messaging or comments on posts).
4.3 A wide variety of organisations provide these services to users. This will mean
that companies of all sizes will be in scope of the regulatory framework. The scope will
include companies from a range of sectors, including social media companies, public
discussion forums, retailers that allow users to review products online, along with non-profit
organisations, file sharing sites and cloud hosting providers.
4.4 This comprehensive approach is important for the efficacy of the new regulatory
framework.
4.5 We also recognise the importance of minimising undue burdens on organisations in
scope and of avoiding uncertainty about how regulation will apply. To ensure a proportionate
approach and avoid being overly burdensome, the application of the regulatory requirements
and the duty of care model will reflect the diversity of organisations in scope, their capacities,
and what is technically possible in terms of proactive measures, including for those providing
ancillary services such as caching (the process of temporarily storing data in either a
PART 4: Technology, education and awareness 91
The BBC’s ‘Young Reporter’ project works with young people aged 11-18 in schools,
colleges and youth organisations to help them navigate news and current affairs and give
them the skills to produce their own reports and share story ideas about what matters
to them.
Through the project, all schools have been given access to free online materials including
classroom activities, video tutorials and the BBC iReporter game. This interactive game
uses the principles of journalism to guide critical thinking by putting the player in the heart
of the newsroom on the day of a breaking news story.
9.14 While we welcome these initiatives, we believe that there are notable gaps in provision
and that adults need support too – for themselves but also as parents. Ofcom’s Children
and parents: Media use and attitudes report 2018 (January 2019)83 notes that parents and
carers are increasingly worried about the internet, and are finding controlling screen time
harder. Fifty per cent of parents are concerned about the data companies are collecting on
children and young people’s online activities. They also worry about children damaging their
reputations, the pressures of children to spend money and the possibility of children being
radicalised online.
9.15 Government is committed to continuing to support parents in preventing and dealing
with online harms. Government welcomes the support provided by the UK Safer Internet
Centre. They produce a free Safer Internet Day resource pack for parents and carers, most
recently in February 2019, helping parents and carers understand the facts about online risks
and have positive conversations with their children about staying safe online.
9.16 However, for adults, there is insufficient messaging or resources covering online
media literacy. There is a need for further work to address issues such as the sharing of
disinformation, catfishing (i.e. luring someone into a relationship by means of a fictional online
persona), attacks on women online (particularly public figures), and the differing needs of
people with disabilities when navigating information. We also recognise the need for improved
coordination of activity. Ofcom is working with a number of partners to assess existing
research and evidence about people’s attitudes and understanding of being online. This will
assist policy-makers to identify gaps and opportunities.
Online safety apps: NewsGuard Box 39
NewsGuard was first launched in the US in March 2018 by journalists to tackle the
problem of disinformation online and is now available to UK users.
• NewsGuard rates and reviews news and information websites using nine standards
of credibility and transparency, allocating a ‘nutrition label’ review which provides
information on the site’s ownership, financing, content, credibility, transparency
and history.
• The NewsGuard desktop browser extension displays these ‘nutrition labels’ next
to headlines in social media feeds and search results. This has been rolled out in
libraries in the US, and Microsoft now offers the extension as an optional setting in
the desktop and mobile versions of its Edge browser.

Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI
On 8 April 2019, the High-Level Expert Group on AI presented Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy
Artificial Intelligence. This followed the publication of the guidelines' first draft in December 2018 on
which more than 500 comments were received through an open consultation.
According to the Guidelines, trustworthy AI should be:
(1) lawful - respecting all applicable laws and regulations
(2) ethical - respecting ethical principles and values
(3) robust - both from a technical perspective while taking into account its social environment
Download the Guidelines in your language below:
BG | CS | DE | DA | EL | EN | ES | ET | FI | FR | HR | HU | IT | LT | LV | MT | NL | PL | PT | RO | SK | SL | SV
The Guidelines put forward a set of 7 key requirements that AI systems should meet in order to be
deemed trustworthy. A specific assessment list aims to help verify the application of each of the key
requirements:
Human agency and oversight: AI systems should empower human beings, allowing them to
make informed decisions and fostering their fundamental rights. At the same time, proper
oversight mechanisms need to be ensured, which can be achieved through human-in-the-loop,
human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches
Technical Robustness and safety: AI systems need to be resilient and secure. They need to be
safe, ensuring a fall back plan in case something goes wrong, as well as being accurate, reliable
and reproducible. That is the only way to ensure that also unintentional harm can be minimized
and prevented.
Privacy and data governance: besides ensuring full respect for privacy and data protection,
adequate data governance mechanisms must also be ensured, taking into account the quality
and integrity of the data, and ensuring legitimised access to data.
Transparency: the data, system and AI business models should be transparent. Traceability
mechanisms can help achieving this. Moreover, AI systems and their decisions should be
explained in a manner adapted to the stakeholder concerned. Humans need to be aware that
they are interacting with an AI system, and must be informed of the system’s capabilities and
limitations.
Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness: Unfair bias must be avoided, as it could could have
multiple negative implications, from the marginalization of vulnerable groups, to the
exacerbation of prejudice and discrimination. Fostering diversity, AI systems should be
accessible to all, regardless of any disability, and involve relevant stakeholders throughout their
entire life circle.
Societal and environmental well-being: AI systems should benefit all human beings, including
future generations. It must hence be ensured that they are sustainable and environmentally
friendly. Moreover, they should take into account the environment, including other living beings,
and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered.
Accountability: Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability
for AI systems and their outcomes. Auditability, which enables the assessment of algorithms,
data and design processes plays a key role therein, especially in critical applications. Moreover,
adequate an accessible redress should be ensured.
The AI HLEG has also prepared a document which elaborates on a Definition of Artificial Intelligence
used for the purpose of the Guidelines.

The document also provides an assessment list that operationalises the key requirements and offers
guidance to implement them in practice. Starting from the 26th of June, this assessment list
underwent a piloting process, to which all stakeholders were invited to test the assessment list and
provide practical feedback on how it can be improved.
Feedback was received through different tracks:
An open survey or “quantitative analysis” sent to all those who registered to the piloting
In-depth interviews with a number of representative organisations to gather more detailed
feedback for different sectors
Continuous possibility to upload feedback and best practices through the European AI Alliance
The piloting phase closed on 1 December 2019
Based on the feedback received, the AI HLEG presented the final Assessment List for Trustworthy AI
(ALTAI) in July 2020. ALTAI is practical tool that translates the Ethics Guidelines into an accessible
and dynamic (self-assessment) checklist. The checklist can be used by developers and deployers of AI
who want to implement the key requirements in practice. This new list is available as a prototype web
based tool and in PDF format.

Public perceptions of online services
The internet is now the fundamental infrastructure of our lives. It’s where we seek out
news and democratic debate, find work, do our shopping, search for love, and cat videos.
The ubiquitous online services that make up this world are widely recognised as a
positive force in society: our
People, Power and Technology research finds 50% of people
think the internet makes life
a lot better for people like them, while only 6% feel it’s had
a negative impact on them overall.5
But our relationship with the internet is complicated. Only 12% think it’s had a positive
impact on society overall. In recent surveys, only
5% of Brits trust social media platforms
with their data,6 and just 36% see search engines as trustworthy.7 Half support greater
regulation of the tech sector,8 whilst the majority of people in the UK think tech
companies put profits ahead of the welfare of their users.9
This “techlash” reflects a legitimate sense that the negative impacts of technological
change are becoming increasingly prevalent and that companies could do more to
protect people when things go wrong on their services.
Ofcom finds 78% of adults report unprompted concerns about using the internet,10
ranging from misuse of data to cyber-scams and online abuse. Nearly two thirds of
people have had a potentially harmful experience online in the last year alone.11
The nature of these negative experiences varies significantly. Parents and teenagers tend
to worry more about the content and conduct that young people experience on the
internet, while adults see personal data privacy, spam and fraud as bigger concerns.12
And since 2010 the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has handed out 216 fines
that could reach a total of over £320 million, if British Airways and Marriott’s appeals
against their penalties are unsuccessful. Around half of these incidents relate to data
breaches, with 27% due to nuisance calls and 22% for text and email spam.13
Across online services, from e-commerce platforms to search engines and social media
sites, the issues encountered by people are diverse. Ofcom finds Facebook to be the
platform where users most frequently experienced harm,14 which reflected the
experiences of some of those we spoke to in our own research.
“I changed my profile settings and avoided all social media for a couple of weeks, as I
did not want to have a repeat of the situation” - Research Participant who was subject
to online sexual harassment. From
Engaging the Public with Responsible Technology.15
The perceived risk of potential harm can also create, in the words of consultation
respondent Robert Seddon, a “pervasive chilling effects” of fears about going online:
people may self-censor to avoid social media abuse or stay away from needed products
and services they believe will open them up to scams.
doteveryone.org.uk hello@doteveryone.org.uk 2
But switching off is a poor remedy and deprives people of the benefits they can reap
from digital products and services. Instead, people should be able to use technology,
confident that if they face a problem, they have somewhere to turn. It’s vital though that
the solutions reflect the diverse and changing nature of problems people will encounter.
Fast-moving regulation from GDPR to Online Harms
Digital regulation and technologies are constantly evolving. 2017 saw the introduction of
the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the UK, the Government’s
proposed Online Harms regulation, which promises a “world-leading package to keep
users safe online”, may come into law in 2020.16
Under these proposals online services will, for the first time, have a legal duty of care to
protect users from over 20 types of “online harms”, including both recognised illegal
harms such as online hate speech as well as issues with fuzzier definitions like
disinformation.
Regulation can be an important lever to promote responsible technology and halt the
decline of public trust in online services.17 But this requires the public to be able to
exercise the new rights and protections regulation affords. Empowering the public to
keep up with their evolving and increasingly complex digital rights is a significant
challenge.
In the run-up to, and following the launch of the GDPR, both the European Commission
and British Government ran extensive advertising campaigns to inform the public of their
new data rights.
The ICO’s
Your Data Matters18 campaign to raise public awareness of their rights under
the Data Protection Act received 17.5m visits to the website in 2018/19, with around 9.5
million users.19 This awareness drive was accompanied, for many, by a tsunami of emails
from businesses to their customers advising them of the changes they had made to
comply with these new laws.20
Even after these considerable efforts, a significant proportion of people are still yet to
fully understand the powers GDPR grants them. Recent European Commission research
found that a quarter of the UK public are aware of the legislation but don’t know what it
means for them in practice, while 28% had never heard of it.21
And in the e-commerce space, awareness of the different rights at play is mixed:
Citizens Advice finds that 69% of the public feel comfortable of their rights when
shopping online,22 but in practice only 21% have an accurate understanding of
“subscription traps” (where a consumer is tricked into agreeing to a subscription through
the advertising of a “free trial” or reduced price offer online).23
doteveryone.org.uk hello@doteveryone.org.uk 3
The current landscape for digital rights and redress
Despite updates in legislation, the protections available to the public remain fragmented
and often inadequate. Our research finds only 26% of people know who to turn to when
they experience a problem online.29
And even when they do, their experiences are often unsatisfactory.
Companies are - and should be - the first port of call for people who’ve encountered a
problem. There are currently few available statistics about either the number of
complaints tech companies receive, or about users’ satisfaction in how they are handled.
And many people are sceptical that the platforms will act in good faith: 43% of
People,
Power and Technology respondents say they consent to online services’ terms and
conditions even if they have concerns, because the companies “will do what they want
anyway”.
Labour MP Yvette Cooper questioned what social media platforms were doing to stop
harmful content, after being told three times in 18 months by senior staff that they were
working on it and yet saw no change.30
"“You see stuff [on social media] and you think “I don’t want to see that”... Thousands of
people will report it, but two days later it will still be there.” - Ofcom Research
Participant.31
Where people raise complaints to external bodies, the response is also poor. In April
2019, 9,000 cybercrime cases raised with Action Fraud had been held in quarantine and
therefore went uninvestigated. And over half of the cybercrimes that were investigated
over the past 5 years were closed without identifying a suspect.32
There are many issues which do not meet the threshold of a criminal investigation but
where the public should have the right to have their complaints’ heard and resolved. For
these, the public must navigate a range of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) providers,
regulators and consumer advocacy bodies.
Data issues are dealt with by the ICO, whilst organisations including Action Fraud and
Citizens Advice offer support to victims of cyber-scams. E-commerce disputes can be
referred to sectoral consumer ombudsman and ADR providers that deal with equivalent
products in the offline world. The Independent Press Standards Organisation and
IMPRESS arbitrate complaints about online news providers that have volunteered to be
under their remit, whilst the Advertising Standards Authority scrutinises online
advertising.
Even with this plethora of organisations, there remain gaps in the landscape. For
example, in online gaming 65% of players report experiencing “severe harassment”,33 and
the Anti-Bullying Alliance argues that platforms do not even enforce their own
community guidelines in these situations.34 Fortnite have received an ‘F’ rating from the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 (General Assembly resolution 217 A) as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected and it has been translated into over 500 languages. The UDHR is widely recognized as having inspired, and paved the way for, the adoption of more than seventy human rights treaties, applied today on a permanent basis at global and regional levels (all containing references to it in their preambles). 
Preamble
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,
Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,
Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,
Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,
Now, therefore,
The General Assembly,
Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

enterprise’s leverage over the entity concerned, how crucial the relationship
is to the enterprise, the severity of the abuse, and whether terminating
the relationship with the entity itself would have adverse human rights
consequences.
The more complex the situation and its implications for human rights, the
stronger is the case for the enterprise to draw on independent expert advice
in deciding how to respond.
If the business enterprise has leverage to prevent or mitigate the adverse
impact, it should exercise it. And if it lacks leverage there may be ways for
the enterprise to increase it. Leverage may be increased by, for example,
offering capacity-building or other incentives to the related entity, or
collaborating with other actors.
There are situations in which the enterprise lacks the leverage to prevent
or mitigate adverse impacts and is unable to increase its leverage. Here,
the enterprise should consider ending the relationship, taking into account
credible assessments of potential adverse human rights impacts of doing so.
Where the relationship is “crucial” to the enterprise, ending it raises further
challenges. A relationship could be deemed as crucial if it provides a
product or service that is essential to the enterprise’s business, and for which
no reasonable alternative source exists. Here the severity of the adverse
human rights impact must also be considered: the more severe the abuse,
the more quickly the enterprise will need to see change before it takes a
decision on whether it should end the relationship. In any case, for as long
as the abuse continues and the enterprise remains in the relationship, it
should be able to demonstrate its own ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact
and be prepared to accept any consequences – reputational, financial or
legal – of the continuing connection.
20. In order to verify whether adverse human rights impacts are being
addressed, business enterprises should track the effectiveness of their
response. Tracking should:
(a) Be based on appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators;
(b) Draw on feedback from both internal and external sources,
including affected stakeholders.
32
Operational-level grievance mechanisms perform two key functions
regarding the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights.
• First, they support the identification of adverse human rights impacts as
a part of an enterprise’s ongoing human rights due diligence. They do
so by providing a channel for those directly impacted by the enterprise’s
operations to raise concerns when they believe they are being or will
be adversely impacted. By analysing trends and patterns in complaints,
business enterprises can also identify systemic problems and adapt their
practices accordingly;
• Second, these mechanisms make it possible for grievances, once
identified, to be addressed and for adverse impacts to be remediated
early and directly by the business enterprise, thereby preventing harms
from compounding and grievances from escalating.
Such mechanisms need not require that a complaint or grievance amount
to an alleged human rights abuse before it can be raised, but specifically
aim to identify any legitimate concerns of those who may be adversely
impacted. If those concerns are not identified and addressed, they may
over time escalate into more major disputes and human rights abuses.
Operational-level grievance mechanisms should reflect certain criteria to
ensure their effectiveness in practice (Principle 31). These criteria can be
met through many different forms of grievance mechanism according to the
demands of scale, resource, sector, culture and other parameters.
Operational-level grievance mechanisms can be important complements
to wider stakeholder engagement and collective bargaining processes,
but cannot substitute for either. They should not be used to undermine the
role of legitimate trade unions in addressing labour-related disputes, nor
to preclude access to judicial or other non-judicial grievance mechanisms.
30. Industry, multi-stakeholder and other collaborative initiatives that are
based on respect for human rights-related standards should ensure
that effective grievance mechanisms are available.
Commentary
Human rights-related standards are increasingly reflected in commitments
undertaken by industry bodies, multi-stakeholder and other collaborative
initiatives, through codes of conduct, performance standards, global
33
framework agreements between trade unions and transnational
corporations, and similar undertakings.
Such collaborative initiatives should ensure the availability of effective
mechanisms through which affected parties or their legitimate representatives
can raise concerns when they believe the commitments in question have
not been met. The legitimacy of such initiatives may be put at risk if
they do not provide for such mechanisms. The mechanisms could be at
the level of individual members, of the collaborative initiative, or both.
These mechanisms should provide for accountability and help enable the
remediation of adverse human rights impacts.
EFFECTIvENESS CRITERIA FOR NON-jUDICIAl GRIEvANCE MECHANISMS
31. In order to ensure their effectiveness, non-judicial grievance
mechanisms, both State-based and non-State-based, should be:
(a) legitimate: enabling trust from the stakeholder groups for whose
use they are intended, and being accountable for the fair conduct
of grievance processes;
(b) Accessible: being known to all stakeholder groups for whose use
they are intended, and providing adequate assistance for those
who may face particular barriers to access;
(c) Predictable: providing a clear and known procedure with an
indicative time frame for each stage, and clarity on the types
of process and outcome available and means of monitoring
implementation;
(d) Equitable: seeking to ensure that aggrieved parties have
reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise
necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair, informed and
respectful terms;
(e) Transparent: keeping parties to a grievance informed about
its progress, and providing sufficient information about the
mechanism’s performance to build confidence in its effectiveness
and meet any public interest at stake;
34
(f) Rights-compatible: ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord
with internationally recognized human rights;
(g) A source of continuous learning: drawing on relevant measures
to identify lessons for improving the mechanism and preventing
future grievances and harms;
Operational-level mechanisms should also be:
(h) Based on engagement and dialogue: consulting the stakeholder
groups for whose use they are intended on their design and
performance, and focusing on dialogue as the means to address
and resolve grievances.
Commentary
A grievance mechanism can only serve its purpose if the people it is
intended to serve know about it, trust it and are able to use it. These criteria
provide a benchmark for designing, revising or assessing a non-judicial
grievance mechanism to help ensure that it is effective in practice. Poorly
designed or implemented grievance mechanisms can risk compounding
a sense of grievance amongst affected stakeholders by heightening their
sense of disempowerment and disrespect by the process.
The first seven criteria apply to any State-based or non-State-based,
adjudicative or dialogue-based mechanism. The eighth criterion is specific
to operational-level mechanisms that business enterprises help administer.
The term “grievance mechanism” is used here as a term of art. The term
itself may not always be appropriate or helpful when applied to a specific
mechanism, but the criteria for effectiveness remain the same. Commentary
on the specific criteria follows:
(a) Stakeholders for whose use a mechanism is intended must trust it
if they are to choose to use it. Accountability for ensuring that the
parties to a grievance process cannot interfere with its fair conduct
is typically one important factor in building stakeholder trust;
(b) Barriers to access may include a lack of awareness of the mechanism,
language, literacy, costs, physical location and fears of reprisal;
(c) In order for a mechanism to be trusted and used, it should provide
public information about the procedure it offers. Time frames for
35
each stage should be respected wherever possible, while allowing
that flexibility may sometimes be needed;
(d) In grievances or disputes between business enterprises and
affected stakeholders, the latter frequently have much less access
to information and expert resources, and often lack the financial
resources to pay for them. Where this imbalance is not redressed, it
can reduce both the achievement and perception of a fair process
and make it harder to arrive at durable solutions;
(e) Communicating regularly with parties about the progress of
individual grievances can be essential to retaining confidence
in the process. Providing transparency about the mechanism’s
performance to wider stakeholders, through statistics, case studies
or more detailed information about the handling of certain cases,
can be important to demonstrate its legitimacy and retain broad
trust. At the same time, confidentiality of the dialogue between
parties and of individuals’ identities should be provided where
necessary;
(f) Grievances are frequently not framed in terms of human rights
and many do not initially raise human rights concerns. Regardless,
where outcomes have implications for human rights, care should be
taken to ensure that they are in line with internationally recognized
human rights;
(g) Regular analysis of the frequency, patterns and causes of grievances
can enable the institution administering the mechanism to identify
and influence policies, procedures or practices that should be
altered to prevent future harm;
(h) For an operational-level grievance mechanism, engaging with
affected stakeholder groups about its design and performance can
help to ensure that it meets their needs, that they will use it in
practice, and that there is a shared interest in ensuring its success.
Since a business enterprise cannot, with legitimacy, both be the
subject of complaints and unilaterally determine their outcome,
these mechanisms should focus on reaching agreed solutions
through dialogue. Where adjudication is needed, this should be
provided by a legitimate, independent third-party mechanism.

Our mission
The mission of the Ada Lovelace Institute is to ensure that data and AI work for
people and society. We believe that a world where data and AI work for people and
society is a world in which the opportunities, benefits and privileges generated by
data and AI are justly and equitably distributed and experienced.
We recognise the power asymmetries that exist in ethical and legal debates around
the development of data-driven technologies, and will represent people in those
conversations. We focus not on the types of technologies we want to build, but on
the types of societies we want to build.
Through research, policy and practice, we aim to ensure that the transformative
power of data and AI is used and harnessed in ways that maximise social wellbeing
and put technology at the service of humanity.

About Ada Lovelace
The Ada Lovelace Institute was established by the Nuffield Foundation in early 2018, in collaboration with the Alan Turing Institute, the Royal Society, the British Academy, the Royal Statistical Society, the Wellcome Trust, Luminate, techUK and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics.
Ada Lovelace (1815–52) has been adopted globally as a trailblazer for women in maths and science; the daughter of Romantic poet Lord Byron, she was educated by her mother Anne Isabella Noel Byron to excel in mathematics. Her most influential work and writings were produced in relation to Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, designed in 1837.
At the Ada Lovelace Institute, we are uniquely connected to Ada’s legacy and conscious every day of the high standards she set for intellectual rigour and analysis. Read more about What Ada means to us.

Empowering organisations worldwide to build a sustainable digital future
Today more than ever, we need to reflect critically on our relationship with technology. How do digital technologies impact the way we get informed and make decisions? How can we as a society face the 'side-effects' of an increasingly data-driven world?
At Tactical Tech, a Berlin-based non-profit organisation, we design and co-develop playful and forward-looking experiences, interventions, events and educational resources that invite people to think about how technology influences their lives and changes the world they live in.
Since 2013, we have joined forces with a global network of partners and civil society organisations, collaborating at the intersection of technology, research, design and art on projects that promote conversations and encourage proactive solutions.
We empower communities and individuals to forge lasting digital transformations by building resilience in organisations.
Our work focuses on these areas:
What we offer:
How do we do it?
    We design and produce creative, award-winning resources that are accessible to everyone
Tactical Tech’s resources and interventions are open-source, adaptable, scalable and localisable, making them accessible to diverse audiences.
Our partners worldwide further develop these resources that combine tech, design, and interactive formats by adapting them to their specific goals and the needs of their communities. Our collaborations enable us to learn from our partners, continuously improving our resources.
    We collaborate with impactful partners across the world
We work towards a sustainable digital future by working collaboratively and empowering existing social structures – such as libraries, schools, and community centres as well as field influencers, journalists and rights organisations.
During the last 20 years, we built a global network of partners in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin and North America who lead local conversations and transformations around the digital challenges by engaging and involving their communities.
Our work is possible thanks to the support of our founders

About
About
We convene researchers, policymakers, technologists, journalists, entrepreneurs, artists, and lawyers to challenge the power and purpose of technology in society.
Data & Society is an independent nonprofit research organization. We believe that empirical evidence should directly inform the development and governance of new technology. We study the social implications of data and automation, producing original research to ground informed, evidence-based public debate about emerging technology.
We combine academic rigor with creative outreach to connect, convene, and sustain expert and practitioner networks. Since 2014, Data & Society has defined the field with original research and programming to break down disciplinary silos and connect provocative thinkers across sectors.
Our work acknowledges that the same innovative technologies and sociotechnical practices that are reconfiguring society – enabling novel modes of interaction, new opportunities for knowledge, and disruptive business practices and paradigms – can be abused to invade privacy, provide new tools of discrimination, and harm individuals and communities.
The work and well-being of Data & Society is strengthened by the diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture, experience, and much more. We are committed to ensuring that a wide array of perspectives are heard, and that our research is made free and available to the public.

Statement of Independence
Data & Society is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) research institute. We are committed to the independence and autonomy of Data & Society’s initiatives and convenings. We do not accept funding that would affect our ability to pursue work free of external interference, and we fiercely protect the independence of our researchers and fellows in their intellectual activities and individual funding relationships.
Our Values
Our research and engagement hews to the following values:
    Independence: Independence is the foundation of rigorous empirical research. We select our projects, choose methodologies, and make publishing decisions based on our analysis of the issues at hand. We do not accept funding that would compromise the independence or rigor of our work.
    Integrity: Organizational integrity requires trust, accountability, and transparency. We build trust and accountability through our independent research, our transparent funding relationships and organizational practices, and our inclusive outreach to a wide range of communities and individuals.
    Equity: Individuals and their communities require respect and dignity. We recognize and embrace differences among us, and center these differences because of a fundamental respect for diversity and a desire to challenge existing power relations in data-centric fields. This requires equitable hiring and retention, centering community experiences in our research, and adhering to the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all organizational activities.
    Creativity: Non-traditional approaches challenge existing structures of power. We support interdisciplinary work and the fundamental value of creative expression. Externally, we support innovative thinking that engages multiple audiences, especially on concepts that challenge dominant narratives about data-centric technologies. Internally, we enable research and engagement that take risks with practices and output.

Why We’re Here
Artificial Intelligence systems are being applied to many arenas of human life – across major sectors such as education, health care, criminal justice, housing, and employment – influencing significant decisions that impact individuals, populations, and national agendas.
But the vast majority of AI systems and related technologies are being put in place with minimal oversight, few accountability mechanisms, and little information about their broader implications. Those developing these systems are generally private companies, whose incentives do not always align with those of the populations on whom they are used, even as these systems are rapidly integrated into core social domains.
To ensure that all AI is sensitive and responsive to the people who bear the highest risk of bias, error, or exploitation, we will need to develop new ways to identify, understand, analyze, and ensure these systems –– and those developing and deploying them –– are accountable.
What We Do
Founded in 2017, the AI Now Institute produces interdisciplinary research and public engagement on the social implications of artificial intelligence. We aim to:
    Measure and understand the effects of AI in society.
    Work with those directly impacted by the use of AI to shape standards and practices that mitigate harm and inform just AI deployment.
    Help shape a rigorous and inclusive field focused on these issues.
Currently, our research focuses on four key domains: rights and liberties, labor, bias and inclusion, and infrastructure.

Funding
AI Now does not currently take funding from corporate donors, including tech companies whose practices and products our work is dedicated to examining.
Our current funding comes from foundations, listed on this page. In many cases this funding is earmarked for specific projects, but does not shape nor dictate our research outcomes. We continue to be committed to unflinching and rigorous research into the social implications of artificial intelligence technologies and the institutions that develop and use them. We don’t allow our funders or the institutions with which we’re affiliated––past or present, corporate, foundation-based, or educational––to dictate our areas of research or influence our findings and recommendations. We believe our research outputs speak to this commitment.

Sometimes the online world reveals unsuspected parallel dimensions. This is an unknown restyle of Neural independently (and secretly as we never knew about it) made by NY-based Motion and Graphic Designer, Clarke Blackham. Very nicely made, perhaps only a bit glossier for the magazine’s line, it testifies once more how even your most familiar outcomes can have another life somewhere else.

The value of craft after software sounds rampant sometimes, expressing the freedom of escaping repetitive taps and clicks to accomplish some assumed tasks. Mixing media, electricity, electronics, mechanics and inert objects Graham Dunning has realised a structured track/performance/open script in his “Mechanical Techno: Ghost in the Machine Music.” More than a proof of concept a machine music declination.

Isn’t ASCII Art a perfect form of “graffiti” in 2010s? The 8-bit aesthetics is among the strongest visual references connecting the analogue recent past with the omni-digital present, so why not adopt it to finally have some public art embedded in the present? In Varberg, Sweden, 2016, the GOTO80 crew (feat: Karin Andersson) did it, choosing (not by accident) the Mo Soul Amiga-font.

The relationship between Andy Warhol and personal computers (becoming quite popular during his last years) has been only partially investigated beyond his Amiga works. In November 2015, Sotheby’s sold his “Apple (from Ads)” (acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas) for 910.000 USD, and in catalogue’s notes Warhol tells about his meeting with Steve Jobs insisting to give him one and showing him how to draw (even if still in black and white): “we went into Sean [John Lennon’s son]’s bedroom–and there was a kid there setting up the Apple computer that Sean had gotten as a present, the Macintosh model. I said that once some man had been calling me a lot wanting to give me one, but that I’d never called him back or something, and then the kid looked up and said, ‘Yeah, that was me. I’m Steve Jobs.’ And he looked so young, like a college guy. And he told me that he would still send me one now. And then he gave me a lesson on drawing with it. It only comes in black and white now, but they’ll make it soon in color…I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who helped invent it.”

About
Neural is a printed magazine established in 1993 dealing with new media art, electronic music and hacktivism. It was founded by Alessandro Ludovico and Minus Habens Records label owner Ivan Iusco in Bari (Italy). In its first issue (distributed in November 1993) there was the only translation in Italian of the William Gibson’s Agrippa (a book of the dead) book.
The first topics covered were: cyberpunk (both as a literally and political movement), electronic music, networks and BBS, virtual reality, media, science fiction and UFO. The magazine’s mission was to be a magazine of ideas, becoming a node in a larger network of digital culture publishers. The magazine was also committed to give its topics a proper visual frame: focusing on graphic design and how it could have expressed the electronic culture in a sort of printed ‘interface’, exploiting at the same time the “sensorial” possibilities of the printed page. So, for example the page numbering was strictly in binary numbers for 3 years, then decimal figures were added aside. There was a department with stereogram pictures and the centerfold hosted a few optical art artworks. The graphic design included a fixed space in every article for contact and links, being inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog experiments.
In issue #18 the centerfold was dedicated to an hacktivist fake. It was made by fake stickers, created by the Italian hacker laboratories’ network. These fake stickers were sarcastically simulating the real ones that are mandatory sticked on any book or compact disc sold in Italy, because of the law supporting the SIAE, the local Author’s and Musicians’ Society. On the one published on Neural is written ‘suggested duplication on any media’.
In 1997 the first Neural website was established, and it was updated daily from September 2000.
In 1998 the topics were restricted to three: media art, with a peculiar attention to the networked and conceptual use of technology in art (the so-called net.art), hacktivism, or activism using electronic media to express itself and electronic music, investigating how the technology is involved in music production, consumption and experimentation.
In May 2002 Neural was one of the founding member of Mag.net, electronic cultural publishers, an international network of magazines, whose slogan is “Collaboration is Better than Competition”. This network was founded during the conference and workshop “Post Media Publishing” that took place at the Universidad International de Andalucia, in Seville (Spain). Since then a few Mag.net meetings, mutal workshops and presentations were done in various countries, and three Mag.net Readers were published as well.
In 2004 Neural.it was awarded with an Honorary Mention in the net.vision category of the Prix Ars Electronica 2004.
In 2007 Neural was part of the Documenta 12 magazines project and Alessandro Ludovico was appointed as an advisor.
Neural magazine started as a bi-monthly but since 1997 it was printed three times in a year (some years it was printed irregularly). It was printed originally in Italian, but since 2003 there are two different printed editions: in English and Italian.

Art+Feminism builds a community of activists that is committed to closing information gaps related to gender, feminism, and the arts, beginning with Wikipedia.
Mission, Vision + Values
Our Story
Wikipedia’s gender trouble is well documented. In a 2011 survey, the Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors identify as female. Further, data analysis tools and computational linguistics studies have concluded that Wikipedia has fewer and less extensive articles on women; those same tools have shown gender biases in biographical articles.
This is a problem.
When cis and trans women, non-binary people, Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities are not represented in the writing and editing on the tenth-most-visited site in the world, information about people like us gets skewed and misrepresented. The stories get mistold. We lose out on real history. That’s why we’re here: to change it.
Since 2014, over 20,000 people at more than 1,500 events around the world have participated in our edit-a-thons, resulting in the creation and improvement of more than 100,000 articles on Wikipedia and its sister projects.
From coffee shops and community centers to the largest museums and universities in the world, Art+Feminism leads a do-it-yourself and do-it-with-others campaign that teaches people of all gender identities and expressions to edit Wikipedia.
Foreign Policy Magazine named the founders Leading Global Thinkers, and publications including Artforum, The New York Times, The New Yorker, CBC, Canadian Art covered the project.
Community Care As the pandemic continues, affecting regions of our international community in varying degrees, Art+Feminism wants to assert our commitment to community care.
Go to Community Care→
Anti-Racism Policy Anti-racism policy is an important [first] step in bringing Art+Feminism into compliance with the mission, vision, and values by recognizing that race, gender, and other forms of identity oppression are tied together and cannot be tackled as distinct issues.

Why We’re Here
Artificial Intelligence systems are being applied to many arenas of human life – across major sectors such as education, health care, criminal justice, housing, and employment – influencing significant decisions that impact individuals, populations, and national agendas.
But the vast majority of AI systems and related technologies are being put in place with minimal oversight, few accountability mechanisms, and little information about their broader implications. Those developing these systems are generally private companies, whose incentives do not always align with those of the populations on whom they are used, even as these systems are rapidly integrated into core social domains.
To ensure that all AI is sensitive and responsive to the people who bear the highest risk of bias, error, or exploitation, we will need to develop new ways to identify, understand, analyze, and ensure these systems –– and those developing and deploying them –– are accountable.
What We Do
Founded in 2017, the AI Now Institute produces interdisciplinary research and public engagement on the social implications of artificial intelligence. We aim to:
    Measure and understand the effects of AI in society.
    Work with those directly impacted by the use of AI to shape standards and practices that mitigate harm and inform just AI deployment.
    Help shape a rigorous and inclusive field focused on these issues.
Currently, our research focuses on four key domains: rights and liberties, labor, bias and inclusion, and infrastructure.

Funding
AI Now does not currently take funding from corporate donors, including tech companies whose practices and products our work is dedicated to examining.
Our current funding comes from foundations, listed on this page. In many cases this funding is earmarked for specific projects, but does not shape nor dictate our research outcomes. We continue to be committed to unflinching and rigorous research into the social implications of artificial intelligence technologies and the institutions that develop and use them. We don’t allow our funders or the institutions with which we’re affiliated––past or present, corporate, foundation-based, or educational––to dictate our areas of research or influence our findings and recommendations. We believe our research outputs speak to this commitment.

OUR MISSION
We’re leading a cultural movement towards EQUITABLE and ACCOUNTABLE AI
We now live in a world where AI governs access to information, opportunity and freedom. However, AI systems can perpetuate racism, sexism, ableism, and other harmful forms of discrimination, therefore, presenting significant threats to our society - from healthcare, to economic opportunity, to our criminal justice system.
The Algorithmic Justice League is an organization that combines art and research to illuminate the social implications and harms of artificial intelligence.
AJL’s mission is to raise public awareness about the impacts of AI, equip advocates with empirical research to bolster campaigns, build the voice and choice of the most impacted communities, and galvanize researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to mitigate AI bias and harms.
We want the world to remember that who codes matters, how we code matters, and that we can code a better future.
THE ALGORITHMIC JUSTICE LEAGUE’S TEAM
Igniting the power of research, art and storytelling
We believe in the power of storytelling for social change. We tell stories that galvanize action with both research and art. We follow a scientific approach to our research, experiments and policy recommendations. We rely on art, freedom and creativity to spread the word, generate awareness about the harms in AI, and amplify the voice of marginalized communities in today’s AI ecosystem. Most importantly, we know making change is a team effort. Fighting for algorithmic justice takes all of us.
Founder
Dr. Joy Buolamwini (she/her)
A poet of code and AI researcher motivated by personal experiences of algorithmic discrimination, Joy shared her story in a TED featured Talk that has over 1.4 million views and launched the Algorithmic Justice League in 2016.

OUR PRINCIPLES
We mitigate the harms and biases of AI by promoting 4 core principles.
Affirmative consent
Everyone should have a real choice in how and whether they interact with AI systems.
meaningful transparency
It is of vital public interest that people are able to understand the processes of creating and deploying AI in a meaningful way, and that we have full understanding of what AI can and cannot do.
Continuous oversight and accountability
Politicians and policymakers need to create robust mechanisms that protect people from the harms of AI and related systems both by continuously monitoring and limiting the worst abuses and holding companies and other institutions accountable when harms occur. Everyone, especially those who are most impacted, must have access to  redress from AI harms. Moreover, institutions and decision makers that utilize AI technologies must be subject to accountability that goes beyond self-regulation.
Actionable critiquE
We aim to end harmful practices in AI, rather than name and shame. We do this by conducting research and translating what we’ve learned into principles, best practices and recommendations that we use as the basis for our advocacy, education and awareness-building efforts. We are focused on shifting industry practices among those creating and commercializing today’s systems.

OUR ORIGINS
The inspiration for the Algorithmic Justice League
Dr. Joy Buolamwini, Founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, came face to face with discrimination. From a machine. It may sound like a scene from a sci-fi movie, but it carries meaningful real-world consequences.
While working on a graduate school project, facial analysis software struggled to  detect her face. She suspected this was more than a technical blunder, but rather than surrender, she responded with curiosity. Her MIT peers with lighter skin color didn’t have the same issues, so Joy tried drawing a face on the palm of her hand. The machine recognized it immediately. Still, no luck with her real face, so she had to finish her project coding with a white mask over her face in order to be detected. Many questions surfaced giving Joy the motivation and insights to start the Algorithmic Justice League.
2:41
In the early days, Joy committed her research to “unmasking bias” in facial recognition technologies.  As a graduate student at MIT, she discovered large gender and skin type bias in commercially sold products from reputable companies including  IBM and Microsoft. She then co-authored the highly influential Gender Shades paper with Dr. Timnit Gebru, and the follow up Actionable Auditing paper with Agent Deb Raji that put Amazon on its toes. As an artist she began creating pieces to humanize AI harms, with her award winning visual spoken word poem "AI, Ain't I A Woman?" shown in exhibitions around the world. This combination of art and research gained support from hundreds of other researchers to advocate for more equitable and accountable technology. Exclusion and discrimination extend well beyond the facial recognition technologies and affect everything from healthcare and financial services to employment and criminal justice.
The deeper we dig, the more remnants of prejudice we will find in our technology. We cannot afford to look away this time because the stakes are simply too high.  We risk losing the gains made with the civil rights movement and other movements for equality under the false assumption of machine neutrality.
MORE EXAMPLES
Automated systems discriminate on a daily basis
In the US, a widely-used healthcare algorithm falsely concludes that black patients are healthier than equally sick white patients. AI that is used to determine hiring decisions has been shown to amplify existing gender discrimination. Law enforcement agencies are rapidly adopting predictive policing and risk assessment technologies that reinforce patterns of unjust racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. AI systems shape the information we see on social media feeds and can perpetuate disinformation when they are optimized to prioritize attention-grabbing content. The examples are endless.

CONSENT AND TRANSPARENCY
We’re still entitled to basic Human Rights.
We cannot take systems for granted. While technology can give us connectivity, convenience and access, we need to retain the power to make our own decisions. Are we trading convenience for shackles? People must have a voice and a choice in how AI is used.
In the U.S., the teams designing all systems are not inclusive. Less than 20% of people in technology are women and less than 2% are people of color. Also, one in two adults (that’s more than 130 million people) has their face in a facial recognition network. Those databases can be searched and analyzed by unaudited algorithms without any oversight, and the implications are massive. 
Beyond inclusive and ethical practices in designing and building algorithms, we demand that there is more transparency when the systems are being used. We need to know what the inputs are and how were they sourced, how performance is measured, the guidelines for testing, and the potential implications, risks, and flaws when applying them to real-life situations. This isn’t a privacy preference. It’s a violation of our civil liberties, where corporations are making money off of people’s faces and people’s lives are put at risk without their consent.
Michelle Obama
1:15
Sometimes respecting people means making sure your systems are inclusive such as in the case of using AI for precision medicine. at times it means respecting people’s privacy by not collecting any data. and it always means respecting the dignity of an individual."
- Dr. Joy Buolamwini, Poet of Code.
AGENTS OF CHANGE
Calling collaborators, contributors, and volunteers.
As an organization highlighting critical issues in commercial systems, we constantly face the risk of retaliation and attempts at silencing. While some companies react positively to our findings, others do not. Thankfully, we’ve grown as a movement and have the support of the most respected AI researchers, organizations and thousands of “Agents of Change” that believe in our mission.
We saw the power of collaboration come together in a face off with Amazon after they tried to discredit peer-reviewed research. Following Dr. Joy Buolamwini's rebuttals (published here and here), we had more than 70 researchers defend this work and the National Institute of Standards and Technology released a comprehensive study showing extensive racial, gender, and age bias in facial recognition algorithms that validate the concerns raised by the research.
If you believe we all deserve equitable and accountable AI, then you can become an agent of change too. Whether you’re an enthusiast, engineer, journalist, or policy maker, we need you. Contact us or act now.

About
Data Justice Lab
The Data Justice Lab is a space for research and collaboration at Cardiff University’s School of Journalism, Media and Culture (JOMEC). It seeks to advance a research agenda that examines the intricate relationship between datafication and social justice, highlighting the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data.
Our research examines the implications of institutional and organizational uses of data and provides critical responses to potential data harms and misuses. Areas of research include (but are not limited to): Data discrimination, digital labour, prediction and preemption, data ethics, algorithmic governance, social justice-informed design, uses of data by social justice groups, data-related activism and advocacy.
Read an interview with one of the co-directors about the lab for JOMEC’s flagship magazine YouButey!: YouButey_Mayissue.

Data Justice
The collection and processing of massive amounts of data is becoming an increasingly contentious issue. Our financial transactions, communications, movements, relationships, and interactions with government all increasingly generate data that are used to profile and sort groups and individuals. With the ‘platformisation’ of digital media alongside governmental and corporate uses of citizen data, developments in the Internet of Things, smart homes and smart cities, the systematic collection and analysis of massive data sets across our social life is being normalised and entrenched – what has been described as the ‘datafication’ of society. These processes can affect both individuals as well as entire communities that may be denied services and access to opportunities, or wrongfully targeted and exploited. In short, they impact on our ability to participate in society.
With the emergence of this data paradigm comes a new set of power dynamics requiring investigation and critique. Whilst promises of value-neutral information and possibilities for prediction are said to advance better responses to a range of social problems, they may also have serious implications for social inclusion, autonomy, basic freedoms, and established notions of ethics, trust, responsibility and accountability.
The term ‘data justice’ is intended to advance a research agenda that examines the intricate relationship between datafication and social justice by foregrounding and highlighting the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data. The lab brings together our interests in digital media, social justice, and data power and builds on our existing research and activity in these areas.
Data and Social Justice
After the launch of the Lab, two of our co-Directors talked about Data Justice and our plans for the Lab at at the Re:publica conference 2017 in Berlin:

About
About
We convene researchers, policymakers, technologists, journalists, entrepreneurs, artists, and lawyers to challenge the power and purpose of technology in society.
Data & Society is an independent nonprofit research organization. We believe that empirical evidence should directly inform the development and governance of new technology. We study the social implications of data and automation, producing original research to ground informed, evidence-based public debate about emerging technology.
We combine academic rigor with creative outreach to connect, convene, and sustain expert and practitioner networks. Since 2014, Data & Society has defined the field with original research and programming to break down disciplinary silos and connect provocative thinkers across sectors.
Our work acknowledges that the same innovative technologies and sociotechnical practices that are reconfiguring society – enabling novel modes of interaction, new opportunities for knowledge, and disruptive business practices and paradigms – can be abused to invade privacy, provide new tools of discrimination, and harm individuals and communities.
The work and well-being of Data & Society is strengthened by the diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture, experience, and much more. We are committed to ensuring that a wide array of perspectives are heard, and that our research is made free and available to the public.

Statement of Independence
Data & Society is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) research institute. We are committed to the independence and autonomy of Data & Society’s initiatives and convenings. We do not accept funding that would affect our ability to pursue work free of external interference, and we fiercely protect the independence of our researchers and fellows in their intellectual activities and individual funding relationships.
Our Values
Our research and engagement hews to the following values:
    Independence: Independence is the foundation of rigorous empirical research. We select our projects, choose methodologies, and make publishing decisions based on our analysis of the issues at hand. We do not accept funding that would compromise the independence or rigor of our work.
    Integrity: Organizational integrity requires trust, accountability, and transparency. We build trust and accountability through our independent research, our transparent funding relationships and organizational practices, and our inclusive outreach to a wide range of communities and individuals.
    Equity: Individuals and their communities require respect and dignity. We recognize and embrace differences among us, and center these differences because of a fundamental respect for diversity and a desire to challenge existing power relations in data-centric fields. This requires equitable hiring and retention, centering community experiences in our research, and adhering to the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all organizational activities.
    Creativity: Non-traditional approaches challenge existing structures of power. We support interdisciplinary work and the fundamental value of creative expression. Externally, we support innovative thinking that engages multiple audiences, especially on concepts that challenge dominant narratives about data-centric technologies. Internally, we enable research and engagement that take risks with practices and output.

Overview
The CDEI is a government expert body enabling the trustworthy use of data and AI. Its multidisciplinary team of specialists, with expertise in data and AI policy, public engagement, computational social science and software engineering, are supported by an advisory board of world-leading experts to deliver, test and refine trustworthy approaches to data and AI governance, working with organisations across the UK.
The CDEI is committed to ensuring that citizens have a voice in how data and data-driven technologies are governed; engaging with the public is therefore a core component of its work. The CDEI’s utilises a range of methodologies, including survey research and focus groups, to build a deep understanding of public attitudes towards the use of data and AI, and the values that citizens want reflected in models of data and AI governance.
Our work this year
The CDEI’s 2021/22 work programme is focused on three areas, aligned with the priorities set out in the National Data Strategy.
Enabling data to be used and shared in a way that is trustworthy
The CDEI is working with partners to pilot new forms of data stewardship and governance. This work supports Mission 1 of the National Data Strategy; to unlock the value of data across the economy. For instance, the CDEI is working with Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy to develop the features of trustworthy Smart Data schemes, and partnering with Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport on the Online Safety Data Initiative, both of which have the potential to define pioneering forms of data governance that will be replicable.
Building an effective AI assurance ecosystem in the UK
Building an effective AI assurance ecosystem will help the UK to realise Mission 2 of the National Data Strategy; to secure a pro-growth and trusted data regime. It will help to manage the risks associated with AI and unlock the benefits, by enabling a range of actors to evaluate and communicate the trustworthiness of AI systems. The CDEI has been developing a roadmap which sets out how the UK can become a global leader in the emerging AI assurance industry, as well as working directly with partners, including with government’s Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (to embed ethical due diligence in the future regulatory framework for self-driving vehicles) and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (to develop guidance on the use of data-driven tools in recruitment).
Facilitating the delivery of transformative data and AI projects in the public sector
The CDEI is helping public sector partners to use data and AI in a way that commands and retains public trust. For example, it has been working with Police Scotland (to develop inclusive governance for the use of data-driven technologies in policing) and the Ministry of Defence (to develop ethical principles for the use of AI across the defence portfolio). The CDEI is also working with the Central Digital and Data Office to develop the UK’s first public sector algorithmic transparency standard, and the Department for Education to write guidance for local authorities on the development and use of data analytics in children’s social care. This work supports Mission 3 of the National Data Strategy; to transform government’s use of data to drive efficiency and improve public services.
Governance
The CDEI benefits from an advisory board of world-leading experts. The advisory board acts as an Expert Committee, comprising technical specialists and thought leaders. Members of the advisory board provide hands-on support on the CDEI’s projects, and play an active role in shaping its work programme.

AI Initiative

About us
Launched in 2017, the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative is a hybrid research effort and philanthropic fund that seeks to ensure that technologies of automation and machine learning are researched, developed, and deployed in a way which vindicate social values of fairness, human autonomy, and justice.
The Initiative is a joint project of the MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society. It incubates a range of research, prototyping, and advocacy activities within these two anchor institutions and across the broader ecosystem of civil society.
At present, the Initiative is supporting work in three domains that we believe to be among the most impactful, near-term arenas of automation and machine learning deployment:
    AI and Justice: What legal and institutional structures should govern the adoption and maintenance of autonomy in public administration? How might approaches such as causal modeling rethink the role that autonomy has to play in areas such as criminal justice?
    Information Quality: Can we measure the influence that machine learning and autonomous systems have on the public sphere? What do effective structures of governance and collaborative development look like between platforms and the public? Can we better ground discussions around policy responses to disinformation in empirical research?
    Autonomy and Interaction: What are the moral and ethical intuitions that the public brings to bear in their interactions with autonomous systems? How might those intuitions be better integrated on a technical level into these systems? What role does design and interface - say, in autonomous vehicles - play in defining debates around interpretability and control?

    About Us
The World Wide Web Foundation was established in 2009 by web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Rosemary Leith to advance the open web as a public good and a basic right. We are an independent, international organisation fighting for a world where everyone has affordable, meaningful access to a web that improves their lives and where their rights are protected.
We use original research, advocacy and public action to shape the policies and products we need for the web we want. Over the past decade we’ve fought successfully to expand internet access, defend net neutrality, protect online privacy, open up public data, and champion local innovation. We’ve helped make internet access more affordable for over 600 million people in low and middle-income countries and secured unprecedented commitments from the world’s biggest tech companies to tackle the abuse of women on their platforms.
Our tight-knit team of around 30 works around the world, including from hubs in Washington DC and London. We celebrate diversity — more than a dozen nationalities are represented at the Web Foundation, and half of our senior managers are women.
Our founder gave the web to the world for free, but fighting for its future comes at a cost. We rely on donations to continue our valuable work. If you’re inspired by our mission, please consider supporting us.

About
Five years fighting for better tech, for everyone.
On 28 May 2020, Doteveryone announced that we would be ending our work after five years of fighting for better tech, for everyone. Since its inception, Doteveryone’s role has been to provoke change in how tech is made and used and to drive others to deliver that. Having set the responsible technology debate in motion we have decided the time has come to stop.
In her 2015 Dimbleby Lecture Martha Lane Fox imagined an organisation called Doteveryone that would put the public at the heart of the conversation around technology and help navigate the new challenges that technological change poses for society.
From that vision Doteveryone has grown to be the go-to voice for responsible technology, demonstrating the need to change how tech is made and used so that it works in the best interests of people, communities and the planet.  We’ve published groundbreaking research into the public’s attitudes and understanding, shown policymakers how to regulate for responsible technology, demonstrated the impact tech has in social care and the gig economy and created practical tools that are helping people innovate responsibly across the world.
The Ada Lovelace Institute will ensure that Doteveryone’s portfolio of research remains in the public realm, while the Open Data Institute will take on our TechTransformed resources for innovating responsibly.
Our report, Five years fighting for better tech for everyone, provides an overview of everything Doteveryone has achieved and includes a timeline of the last five years with links to all our projects. 
The Ada Lovelace Institute now maintains this site to ensure Doteveryone’s work remains in the public realm.

About ORBIT
The Observatory for Responsible Research and Innovation in ICT
ORBIT stands for the Observatory for Responsible Research and Innovation in ICT. ORBIT started as a project funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The project provides services and support for the UK research community to implement and integrate principles of responsible innovation in Research and Innovation activities. It builds on the earlier EPSRC project of a Framework for RRI in ICT.
The aim of the project was always to disseminate as widely as possible the insights gained through research and good practice and developed as part of community engagement and service provision. To ensure that these insights remain available to the research community, in 2020 ORBIT established a training company that could continue to provide the services after the end of the project.
The ORBIT project started in January 2017 with an overall lifetime of 5 years, thus ending in January 2022. ORBIT-RRI Ltd, the company, was created in December 2020, as a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG) (see here for the Companies House entry). This means that it is a not-for-profit company and any income generated by the company has to be used for its purposes as laid down in the Articles and Members Agreement. 
The Articles of Association state that 
      4 NOT FOR PROFIT
             4.1 The Company is not established or conducted for private gain. Any surplus or assets must be used principally for reinvestment.
      5 OBJECTS
             5.1 The objects for which the Company is established (the Objects) are:
                     (a) to seek to promote a culture of responsible research and innovation in information and communications technology and other areas of technology, research and innovation through its support for, continuation and expansion of the Observatory for Responsible Research and Innovation project; […]
The Members Agreement states that: 
“The Company was incorporated in England and Wales as a private company limited by guarantee on 3 December 2020 under the Companies Act 2006 to operate on a “not-for-profit” basis to seek to promote a culture of responsible research and innovation in information and communications technology and other areas of technology, research and innovation through its support for, continuation and expansion of the Observatory for Responsible Research and Innovation project.”
As a CLG, ORBIT-RRI does not have shareholders who benefit financially from the company. Instead, its owners are called Members. ORBIT has five Members: two institutions: De Montfort University, the University of Oxford, and three of its directors: M. Jirotka, M. de Heaver and B. Stahl.
Information and communication technology (ICT) creates huge benefits and has numerous uses. It pervades our personal and professional lives. Despite the many advantages of ICT, there are numerous examples of problems and downsides. ICT can lead to new privacy issues, raises security concerns, can deskill labour or support surveillance. Researchers and innovators in the area of ICT as well as other stakeholders in innovation processes have the opportunity and maybe the duty to consider their role and influence on the desired and undesired consequences of ICT.
Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is a aims to align Research & Innovation (R&I) policy with societal goals. The probably most widely used definition of the term was suggested by von Schomberg (2011, p. 9) who sees it as
    “a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability,  sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products( in order to  allow a proper embedding of scientific  and  technological advances in our society)”.
It is important to underline that the emphasis that this definition places on acceptability and desirability of R&I processes and products can be seen as equivalent to addressing the grand challenges.
Novelty of RRI
Despite the relative novelty of the term itself, it is important to note that RRI can draw on a long history of activities. These include an array of options and methods that aim to clarify possible consequences of R&I activities, such as risk assessment (Kastenhofer, 2011), technology assessment (Grunwald, 2009) or other types of ethics or impact assessments (Wright, Gellert, Gutwirth, & Friedewald, 2011). Attempts to come to a better understanding of possible futures that inform the different types of assessment can be found in technology foresight (Georghiou, Harper, Keenan, Miles, & Popper, 2008; Martin, 2010) and other types of future studies (Sardar, 2010).
RRI and Responsibility
RRI exhibits a novel feature: It explicitly links R&I to responsibility (Grinbaum & Groves, 2013; Owen et al., 2013). This allows shifting the focus to open up new horizons on how to conduct R&I. This does not necessarily mean that it requires new approaches. Instead the major novelty of RRI is the integration of existing approaches such as research ethics and social sciences in a novel way by shifting focus and placing new emphases (Grunwald, 2011). Furthermore, RRI entails new insight into how existing approaches can be embedded ‘in a day-to-day operational context (i.e. implementation and practice).’(Owen & Goldberg, 2010)
RRI is a complex term whose primary purpose is to help societies make difficult and often contested decisions with regards to R&I policy. RRI is based on a number of already existing responsibilities and its novelty and practical relevance is in the fact that these are treated as a whole that needs to be addressed in order to lead to desirable outcomes and contribution to grand challenges.
RRI can therefore be understood as a higher level responsibility or meta-responsibility that aims to shape, maintain, develop, coordinate and align existing and novel research and innovation-related processes, actors and responsibilities with a view to ensuring desirable and acceptable research outcomes. The analysis of the current research landscape in ICT should be sensitive to these different aspects and dimensions of established research governance.

Welcome to the everyday sexism project. It seems to be increasingly difficult to talk about sexism, equality and women’s rights in a modern society that perceives itself to have achieved gender equality. In this ‘liberal’, ‘modern’ age, to complain about everyday sexism or suggest that you are unhappy about the way in which women are portrayed and perceived renders you likely to be labelled ‘uptight’, ‘prudish’, a ‘militant feminist’, or a ‘bra burner’.
The Everyday Sexism project aims to take a step towards gender equality, by proving wrong those who tell women that they can’t complain because we are equal. It is a place to record stories of sexism faced on a daily basis, by ordinary women, in ordinary places. To show that sexism exists in abundance in the UK workplace and that it is very far from being a problem we no longer need to discuss. To provoke responses so numerous and wide-ranging that the problem becomes impossible to ignore. To report the way you have been treated, even if it has not been taken seriously elsewhere. To stand up and say ‘this isn’t right’, even if it isn’t big or outrageous or shocking. Even if you’ve got used to thinking that it is ‘just the way things are’.
Women who complain about disrespectful comments being made to female members in the House of Commons are accused of ‘overreacting’, yet only 22% of MPs are female. Those who object to the sexist portrayal of women in the media are branded ‘killjoys’, yet nearly 70% of speaking parts in Hollywood films are taken by men, (though female characters are five times more likely to strip down to sexy clothing.) Women who object to the over-sexualisation of female celebrities are told ‘it’s a choice’, yet it is almost impossible to think of a modern female singer who hasn’t bared all. Women are told that modern ‘equality’ means career girls can have their cake and eat it, yet only around 13% of FTSE 100 corporate board members are female.
We are encouraged to celebrate the advance of women into the cockpit, yet Ryanair still releases an all-female nude calendar and Virgin flight attendants go to work every day on a plane emblazoned with a cleavage baring, swimsuit clad caricature. We simply aren’t living in an equal society, but we are blasted for ‘whining’ or ‘not knowing how lucky we are’ if we try to point it out.
So please, send me your stories. Send other people to send me their stories. Send me your Nan’s story, your sister’s story or your best friend’s. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you live. It doesn’t matter what you look like or what you believe in. If you have experienced sexism, just everyday, small, so-used-to-it-you-almost-just-accept-it sexism, please share your story so we can prove how widespread the problem really is.

Institute of Network Cultures
The Institute of Network Cultures (INC) analyzes and shapes the terrain of network cultures through events, publications, and online dialogue. Our projects evolve around urgent publishing, alternative revenue models, critical design and making, digital counter culture and much more.
The INC was founded in 2004 by Geert Lovink, following his appointment within the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. A key focus is the establishment of sustainable research networks. Emerging critical topics are identified and shaped in a practical sense. Interdisciplinary in character, the INC brings together researchers, artists, activists, programmers, designers, and students and teachers.
Research
The field of network cultures revolves around the interaction between new forms of media, and the users of such new forms. With a strong focus on the transdisciplinary nature of new media and its DIY and open source components, the INC gives equal attention to the artistic, political and technical aspects of the internet and other emergent media. As such, the INC’s area of research extends to design, activism, art, philosophy, political theory, and urban studies and is not confined to the internet alone. Indeed, the INC maintains that the internet can only be understood at the conjuncture of these various fields and lines of inquiry. ‘Network cultures’ is seen as a strategic instrument to diagnose political and aesthetic developments in user-driven communication. Network cultures rapidly assemble, and can just as quickly disappear, creating a sense of spontaneity, transience, even uncertainty. Yet these forms are here to stay. However self-evident it is, collaboration is a foundation of network cultures.
Model of the INC method, via public research (e.g. conferences) and publications a sustainable network will be formed.
Model of the INC method, via public research (e.g. conferences) and publications a sustainable network will be formed.
The aim of the INC is to create sustainable research networks around emerging topics in which a critical contribution can be made. The formation of a small group of international people, both inside and outside of the academy, may result in a larger online discussion. Together with the researchers and a group of students, interns and volunteers, an event is organized to gather key questions and thinkers. Many of these events, such as a conference, seminar or workshop, culminate in a publication. Formats of publication may include a printed reader, a book, video interviews, wikis, blogs and special online magazine issues, along with conference documentation (photos, video files and podcasts). The publication functions as an important vehicle for the sustainability of the research network.

INC themes
Image culture
These days images form part and parcel of every message when surfing, searching, and interacting. On dedicated platforms like YouTube and Pinterest images are gathered, annotated and shared. Images are more than just illustration: they have retained an autonomous status, digitalization notwithstanding. Online video has to observe its own rules with respect to editing, light, framing, use of sound, and so on. How has this been changed under the influence of digitalization and the ubiquity of digital cameras? What relationship should visual education have to this? And the key question: is the image taking over from the written word? Alongside the technical, economic, and social aspects of the network, its aesthetic component is becoming increasingly important. To understand this better we need to engage in an open, critical dialogue with visual artists, designers, and filmmakers at all levels of the network culture.
Urgent/hybrid/digital publishing
The publishing world is perhaps one of the last big media organizations to be making the transition to the digital domain. So it is now going through a sea-change moment in which new relationships will emerge between writer, publisher, designer and distributor. Many of its older mechanisms may soon no longer work, but in their place new possibilities will arise with regard to formats, reading experiences, social reading, do-it-yourself, business models, and so on. Is the book business – like other media industries – headed towards a model in which content is cut up into parts? What about e-readers and reading online, on your phone?
Revenue models in the arts/MoneyLab
More and more young professionals are entering the market and it is getting harder to find a solid job. Remuneration for web design and app development is falling all the time, while the content itself has been more or less written off and is made available for free. A freelancer’s life is an insecure one. In a moribund economy, finding new income sources is a matter of urgency. IT is getting ever more important, but outsourcing continues to expand. Online funding of the creative sector is still in its infancy and badly needs more research and development. What will future YouTube earnings models look like? Will crowdfunding and Bitcoins supply enough ‘supplementary income’? And where will the basic income come from?
Multidisciplinary engagement
Political action and social involvement are no longer isolated, underground activities, or limited to a small group of activists. People are experimenting with new media and digital technologies everywhere and all the time. Post-2000 a new relationship has arisen between politics and aesthetics, and the technical knowledge needed to effectively deploy new media has spread quickly. Today, ‘compassion fatigue and nihilism are the greatest problems; where do we draw the line between ‘clicktivism’ and real involvement? Is going offline the only option? How can social movements organize themselves, beyond social media? We are in the middle of a quest to find the right balance between virtuality and the street, between networks and squares, as public spaces used to be called in the old days. What do the newest tactics look like to today’s social mix of artists, programmers, researchers, and designers?
Design
Design is more than just the optimization of business processes and information streams. For INC, design is above all an aesthetic expression that asks questions. Design is a skill and an applied art that is essential to anyone building systems for the media and information industries. Without a solid knowledge of visual language, and a critical attitude towards form and functionality, designers end up simply copying standard protocols: the filling in of empty templates. A world without aesthetic practice is a bleak and barren environment, dominated by a pure functionality in which the spirits of both the maker and the user are absent. In design education, it is essential that links are forged between functional informatics and interaction design, not just for students but for everyone who goes online. How do we break out of this ‘urge to optimize’?
Knowledge production
Internet platforms like Google, Wikipedia, and online university modules such as MOOCs are increasingly determining what we mean by ‘knowledge’. In education, digital databases are replacing not only the old-fashioned library but also the teacher’s role as the dispenser of knowledge to the student. If something isn’t on Google then it might as well not exist. What does this mean for a student’s view of the world? Who gets to decide what is important and what is not? It is vital to know what websites like Wikipedia and search engines like Google look like on the inside and to understand how they work, while the process of knowledge production is being increasingly left to software algorithms. What are the real-world politics behind these algorithms, editing bots, and online courses?
